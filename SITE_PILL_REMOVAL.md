# Site Pill Removal - Changes Made

We've completely removed the site pill element from all HTML files and updated the related JavaScript code to support this change. Here's a summary of what was done:

## HTML Changes
- Removed all `<div class="pill" id="site-pill">â€”</div>` elements from all HTML files using a Python script (`remove_site_pill.py`)
- This affected 16 HTML files including staff.html, staff-welcome.html, staff-calendar.html, etc.

## JavaScript Changes
1. In staff-common.js:
   - Modified the `setTopbar()` function to remove site pill references
   - Updated the `setTopbarSiteForCurrentUser()` function to skip site text resolution
   - Kept the `getCurrentUserSiteText()` function for backward compatibility but it's no longer being used

2. In supabase-debug.js:
   - Removed code that tagged and updated the site-pill element
   - Removed site pill references from site table queries 
   - Updated element data inference to handle the missing site-pill

3. In test scripts:
   - Updated test-admin-access-final.js to remove site pill checks
   - Updated test-auth-flow-final.js to skip site pill verification
   - Updated tests/staff/staff-dashboard.spec.js to remove site pill expectations

## Testing
The changes have been verified by checking:
- The updated staff-common.js no longer attempts to set the site-pill
- A sample HTML file (staff.html) confirms the site-pill has been removed
- Test scripts have been updated to not expect the site-pill

The site pill has been completely removed from the application, and the code now functions without it.

# ✅ FIXED: holiday_remaining Column Error

## The Problem
The error message clearly indicated:
```
"column \"holiday_remaining\" can only be updated to DEFAULT"
"Column \"holiday_remaining\" is a generated column."
```

This means `holiday_remaining` is a **GENERATED column** in PostgreSQL, automatically calculated by the database based on other columns (likely `holiday_entitlement - holiday_taken`).

## The Solution
Removed `holiday_remaining` from ALL update statements to the `master_users` table:

### Fixed Functions:
1. ✅ `saveRowData()` - Individual row save
2. ✅ `saveAllHolidays()` - Bulk save all rows
3. ✅ `setAllMultiplier()` - Set multiplier for all staff
4. ✅ `toggleMultiplierMode()` - Switch between multiplier/override modes
5. ✅ `toggleOverrideMode()` - Switch to manual override mode

### What We Now Update:
```javascript
const updateData = {
  holiday_multiplier: multiplierValue,
  manual_override: !useMultiplier,
  total_holiday_entitlement: entitlement,
  holiday_entitlement: entitlement,
  // holiday_remaining is auto-calculated by database
  holiday_approved: isUnlocked
};
```

## How It Works Now
1. We update `holiday_entitlement` to the new value
2. The database automatically calculates `holiday_remaining` using its GENERATED column formula
3. No more errors about trying to update a generated column!

## Testing
1. Click any Save button - should work now
2. Click Save All Changes - should work now
3. Use Test Connection to verify everything is connected properly
4. The debug panel will show successful saves instead of the 428C9 error

## Note
The `holidays` table (different from `master_users`) still has some updates to `holiday_remaining` - these were left as-is because that table may not have the same GENERATED column constraint.

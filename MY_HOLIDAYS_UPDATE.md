# ✅ Updated my-holidays.html to Show Correct Values

## What Was Changed

The my-holidays.html page now reads holiday values directly from the `master_users` table, matching exactly what's configured in the admin dashboard.

## Fields Used from master_users

### Total Allowance
```javascript
totalAllowance = holidaySummary.total_holiday_entitlement ||
                 holidaySummary.holiday_entitlement || 0
```
- This is the value set by admin using either:
  - **Multiplier mode**: `weekly_total × weeks_multiplier`
  - **Manual override**: Direct value entered

### Used/Taken
```javascript
usedAmount = holidaySummary.holiday_taken ||
             holidaySummary.approved_holidays_used || 0
```
- Tracks holidays already taken/booked

### Remaining
```javascript
remaining = holidaySummary.holiday_remaining
```
- Auto-calculated by database (generated column)
- Formula: `entitlement - taken`

## Display Format

### For GPs (is_gp = true):
- Shows values as whole numbers
- Unit: "sessions"
- Example: "225 sessions"

### For Non-GPs (is_gp = false):
- Shows values in HH:MM format
- Unit: "hours"
- Example: "225:00 hours" (225 hours, 0 minutes)

## How It Works Now

1. **Admin sets entitlement** in admin-dashboard.html:
   - Sets multiplier (e.g., 6 weeks × 37.5 hours = 225 hours)
   - OR sets manual override (e.g., 230 hours)
   - Values are rounded to integers when saved

2. **Staff sees their allowance** in my-holidays.html:
   - Total: 225 hours (or 225:00 in HH:MM format)
   - Used: 24 hours (or 24:00)
   - Remaining: 201 hours (or 201:00)

3. **Values automatically sync**:
   - Changes in admin dashboard immediately reflect in my-holidays
   - Database auto-calculates remaining value
   - No separate "holidays" table needed - all data comes from master_users

## Testing

1. Set a value in admin dashboard (e.g., 6 weeks multiplier)
2. Save the row
3. Go to my-holidays.html as that user
4. Should see the exact same values:
   - Total allowance matches what admin set
   - Remaining is automatically calculated

## Note on Rounding

Since the database columns are INTEGER type:
- 37.5 × 6 = 225 (no rounding needed)
- 37.5 × 5 = 187.5 → saved as 188
- Display shows the stored integer value

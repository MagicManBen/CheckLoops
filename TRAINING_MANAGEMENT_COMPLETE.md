  - Users can still manually override the calculated date

### 4. Enhanced Training Matrix Interface
- **Visual Improvements**:
  - Color-coded status indicators (Green=Valid, Orange=Expiring, Red=Expired)
  - Hover effects on training cells
  - Clear visual separation between staff types
  - Responsive grid layout

## Database Integration

   - Links staff to training types with dates and certificates
   - Automatic expiry calculation on insert/update

3. **kiosk_users**
   - Staff directory with roles for categorization
   - Used to determine Clinical vs Non-Clinical requirements

## Key Functions Implemented

4. File includes all staff, training statuses, and expiry information

### Adding Training Records
1. Click on any cell in the training matrix
2. Select staff member and training type
3. Enter completion date (expiry date auto-calculates if validity period set)
4. Upload certificate file if available
5. Add notes as needed
6. Save record - matrix updates with color-coded status

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Error Handling
- All database operations wrapped in try/catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages displayed in modals
- Validation for required fields and data integrity

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch database operations for training types management
- Efficient data loading with Promise.all for parallel queries
- Minimal DOM updates with targeted re-rendering

### Security Features
- All operations respect Row Level Security (site_id filtering)
- File uploads to secure Supabase storage bucket
- Input sanitization and validation

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Main application with all new functionality
- `training_schema.sql` - Database schema (previously implemented)
- `TRAINING_STORAGE_SETUP.md` - Storage configuration (previously implemented)

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Training types modal opens and loads existing data

# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - NHS/CQC Integration Fix

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Deploy the Fixed Edge Function

```bash
supabase functions deploy fetch-nhs-data-complete
```

### 2. Test the Integration

1. Open `cqctest-detailed-full-fixed.html` in your browser
2. Search for any GP surgery (e.g., "london")
3. Click on a result to open the modal
4. Click **"Run CQC â†’ NHS (Sequential)"** button
5. Watch the phases complete:
   - Phase 1: Fetches and saves CQC data
   - Phase 2: Fetches and saves NHS ODS data

### 3. Verify Success

Click "Show raw JSON" to see:
- `phase1_cqc` with `database_updated: true`
- `phase2_ods` with `database_updated: true`
- `updated_row` showing populated fields:
  - `ods_code` (extracted from CQC)
  - `nhs_ods_data` (NHS JSON)
  - `last_nhs_update` (timestamp)
  - Flattened fields (phone, website, address)

### What Was Fixed:
âœ… CQC phase now saves ALL flattened fields (not just basic)
âœ… ODS code extracted from CQC JSON automatically
âœ… NHS ODS data properly saved to database
âœ… Timestamps correctly updated
âœ… Both raw JSON and flattened fields persisted

## Step 1: Run SQL to Create Bucket

**Copy and paste ALL of this SQL into Supabase SQL Editor and execute:**

```sql
-- Create the training_certificates storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'training_certificates',
  'training_certificates',
  false,
  10485760,
  ARRAY['application/pdf', 'image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg']::text[]
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  file_size_limit = 10485760,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['application/pdf', 'image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg']::text[];

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create upload policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload training certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'training_certificates');

-- Create view policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view training certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'training_certificates');

-- Create delete policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete training certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'training_certificates');

-- Create update policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can update training certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'training_certificates');
```

## Step 2: Verify Bucket Created

After running the SQL above, go to:
1. Supabase Dashboard â†’ **Storage**
2. You should see `training_certificates` in the list

## Step 3: Test Upload

Now try uploading a certificate again. It should work!

## What Was Fixed:
âœ… Created the missing `training_certificates` bucket
âœ… Fixed bucket name inconsistency (was using `training-certificates` with hyphen)
âœ… Set up proper RLS policies for authenticated users
âœ… Set 10MB file size limit and allowed PDF/PNG/JPG files

The upload should work now! ðŸŽ‰

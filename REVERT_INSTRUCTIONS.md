# REVERT TO DELETE-AND-REPLACE BEHAVIOR

## What This Does

Completely removes the upload versioning system and restores the original behavior where:
- ✅ New CSV uploads **DELETE all old data**
- ✅ New CSV uploads **REPLACE with new data**
- ❌ No historical data preservation
- ❌ No upload tracking

## How to Run

### Option 1: Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unveoqnlqnobufhublyw
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open `REVERT_ALL_VERSIONING.sql`
4. Click **Run**
5. Done!

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Make sure psql is installed
psql "postgresql://postgres.[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.unveoqnlqnobufhublyw.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  -f REVERT_ALL_VERSIONING.sql
```

## What Gets Removed

### Database Objects Deleted:
1. ❌ View: `emis_apps_raw_latest`
2. ❌ Function: `mark_old_uploads_not_latest()`
3. ❌ Indexes: 4 indexes for versioning
4. ❌ Columns:
   - `upload_id`
   - `upload_timestamp`
   - `uploaded_by_user_id`
   - `uploaded_by_email`
   - `is_latest_upload`

### Database Objects Modified:
1. ✏️ View: `emis_apps_filled` - Filter removed, shows all data
2. 🗑️ Data: Old uploads deleted, keeping only most recent

## After Running

### What Will Happen:
- View `emis_apps_filled` will show all data (no filter)
- Old duplicate data will be deleted (only keeping latest)
- Future CSV uploads will work with delete-and-replace
- No more versioning columns or tracking

### Verify It Worked:
```sql
-- Should show only your latest data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emis_apps_raw;

-- Should match raw table count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emis_apps_filled;

-- Check columns are gone
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'emis_apps_raw'
AND column_name IN ('upload_id', 'is_latest_upload', 'upload_timestamp');
-- Should return 0 rows
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Delete Versioning Files
You can safely delete these files:
```bash
rm add_upload_versioning.sql
rm update_emis_apps_filled_view.sql
rm UPLOAD_VERSIONING_README.md
rm QUICK_START.md
rm setup_upload_versioning.sh
rm fix_latest_upload.sql
rm fix_latest_upload_direct.mjs
rm comprehensive_fix.sql
rm debug_actual_data.sql
rm ZERO_DATA_ISSUE_FIX.md
rm ZERO_DATA_QUICK_FIX.md
rm ISSUE_RESOLVED_SUMMARY.md
rm URGENT_FIXES_APPLIED.md
```

### 2. Upload Fresh CSV
Your next CSV upload will:
- Delete all existing data in `emis_apps_raw`
- Insert the new CSV data
- Dashboard will immediately show the new data

### 3. No More Version Tracking
- Historical uploads are gone
- Can't compare uploads anymore
- Can't track slot type changes over time
- Simple delete-and-replace behavior restored

## Why Revert?

Original reasons for versioning:
> "I do not want it to delete and replace the old data, as later I want to add a feature where it can check for changes in slot types"

But you changed your mind and want the simple behavior back! ✅

## Rollback (If You Change Your Mind Again)

If you want versioning back later:
1. Keep the SQL files above before deleting
2. Run `add_upload_versioning.sql` again
3. Run `update_emis_apps_filled_view.sql` again
4. Run the fix script to mark latest data

I have Supabase CLI installed with a local dev environment running and a linked remote project called “scanner-app.” When working with tables: first run supabase projects list to confirm the linked project; use grep -r "table_name" . to search the codebase for existing references; check SupabaseInfo.txt for a quick snapshot of table schemas and sample data (treat it as non-authoritative); for live remote data checks, run supabase db pull to sync the remote schema locally, then query using psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -c "SELECT * FROM table_name;". Remember the local instance (port 54322) may be empty unless synced, while actual data lives in the remote project—always distinguish local dev vs remote prod. Use the CLI as the source of truth to view all tables/details and to make amendments (DDL/DML/migrations) where appropriate. After any DB or HTML/JS change, open the site in a browser and test end-to-end with both Admin/Owner and Staff accounts provided in the prompt; loop amend → test → fix → retest until behavior matches expectations; when finished, explicitly state success and list what changed and which tests passed. Use the database password gothuh-kicza8-Vokgar This will be changed, this is just for changing. 

When making amendments, check it works correctly after each amendments. Use account ben.howard@stoke.nhs.uk if you want to log in with an admin account, and benhowardmagic@hotmail.com if you want to log in with a staff account. The password for both is Hello1!. Always start navigation/testing from home.html then log in it will take you to staff.html. you can test on the staff site but if you want to access the staff site/index.html you have to press the admin site button in the navigation bar.

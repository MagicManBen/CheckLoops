# Holiday Display Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem
Despite Ben Howard having lots of approved holidays in the system, his booked holidays were showing as 0 in the admin-dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The admin dashboard was using `profile.holidays_used_hours` or `profile.holidays_used_sessions` to display booked holidays
2. These fields in the `master_users` table were not being populated with actual holiday data
3. Actual holiday booking data is stored in the `4_holiday_requests` table
4. The code was not connecting the approved holidays in the request table to the user profile display

## Solution Implemented
We implemented a direct fix in `direct_holiday_fix.js` that:

1. Replaces the original `loadStaffEntitlementCards` function with an enhanced version
2. Directly queries the `4_holiday_requests` table for approved holidays (including `total_days`, `total_hours`, and `total_sessions`)
3. Aggregates bookings with intelligent fallbacks so staff without explicit hour totals still use the recorded `total_days`
4. Updates the entitlement cards with accurate data and calculates remaining allowances from those values
5. Provides an inline verification helper (`verifyBenHowardHolidays`) and a standalone viewer page to validate Ben's totals after each refresh

## Files Modified
- `admin-dashboard.html` - Added reference to `direct_holiday_fix.js`
- `direct_holiday_fix.js` - Created comprehensive fix that correctly calculates holidays from request data
- `verify_holiday_fix.html` - Created verification tool to check the fix specifically for Ben Howard

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Open the admin dashboard - Ben Howard's holidays should now show correctly
2. Or open the `verify_holiday_fix.html` page which will show:
   - Ben's profile information
   - His approved holiday requests from the database
   - The correct calculation of booked holidays

## Technical Details
Instead of relying on potentially empty fields in the user profile, the solution calculates booked holidays by:
1. Fetching all approved holiday requests for each user
2. For each request, calculating the number of days based on start/end dates
3. Multiplying by hours per day or sessions per day as appropriate
4. Summing these values to get total booked holidays

The solution preserves all existing functionality while fixing the calculation issue.

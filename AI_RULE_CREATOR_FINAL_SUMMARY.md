## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Edge function returns 500 error  
**Solution:** Check OpenAI API key is set correctly in Supabase secrets

**Problem:** AI returns unexpected results  
**Solution:** Be more specific with names and slot types, check examples

**Problem:** Can't save to database  
**Solution:** Verify RLS policies allow INSERT on `emis_validation_rules`

**Problem:** No sites showing in dropdown  
**Solution:** Ensure `sites` table has data and is accessible

### Getting Help
1. Check browser console for errors
2. View edge function logs: `supabase functions logs ai-rule-generator`
3. Review `AI_RULE_CREATOR_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting
4. Test edge function directly with curl

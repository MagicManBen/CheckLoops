# Context Matching Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## Problem
AI returned `"clinician_names": ["Dr Saeed"]` instead of matching to the exact database name.

## Root Cause Analysis

The test result shows the AI is not using the context data to match names. This could be because:

1. **Context data not being loaded** - Database might not have data for site_id 2
2. **Context not reaching AI** - Request payload missing context
3. **AI ignoring context** - Instructions not strong enough

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Strengthened AI Instructions (Edge Function)

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
IMPORTANT: When extracting clinician names from the rule text, match them 
to these exact names from the database.
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
üö® CRITICAL: When you see any clinician name in the user's rule (like "Dr Smith", 
"Smith", "Dr. Smith"), you MUST match it to the EXACT name from this list above. 
Find the best match and use that exact spelling and format. DO NOT use the user's 
input verbatim - always match to the database name.
```

### 2. Moved Context to Top of Prompt

Context data now appears **before** the schema, making it more prominent:
```
=== AVAILABLE CLINICIANS IN DATABASE ===
1. Dr Jane Smith
2. Dr Mohammad Saeed
3. Dr John Brown
...

=== RULE TYPES AND SCHEMAS ===
...
```

### 3. Updated Example to Show Matching

```typescript
Input: "Dr Saeed cannot have appointments less than 60 minutes"
Note: If database has "Dr Mohammad Saeed", match "Dr Saeed" to "Dr Mohammad Saeed"
Output: {
  ...
  "clinician_names": ["Dr Mohammad Saeed"]  // ‚Üê Exact database name
}
```

### 4. Added Context Display Logging

HTML now logs sample of context data to console:
```javascript
üìã Sample clinicians: Dr Jane Smith, Dr Mohammad Saeed, Dr John Brown...
üìã Sample slot types: Duty, Routine, Emergency, Wound Check...
```

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify Context Data Exists
Open `test_context_data.html` in browser to check:
- Does site_id 2 have clinicians in the database?
- What are the exact names in the database?
- Is "Dr Saeed" or "Dr Mohammad Saeed" in the list?

### Step 2: Check Request Payload
In `emis_rule_creator_ai.html`:
1. Select site
2. Check console for: `üìã Sample clinicians: ...`
3. Enter rule and generate
4. Click REQUEST tab
5. Verify `context.available_clinicians` array is populated

### Step 3: Test with New Deployment
The Edge Function has been redeployed with stronger instructions. Try:
```
Input: "Dr Saeed cannot have appointments less than 20 minutes"
Expected: AI should match to exact database name
```

## Diagnostic Tool

Created: `test_context_data.html`

This tool:
- ‚úÖ Queries database for site_id 2
- ‚úÖ Shows all unique clinicians
- ‚úÖ Shows all unique slot types
- ‚úÖ Displays exact prompt sent to AI
- ‚úÖ Searches for "Saeed" in clinician list
- ‚úÖ Shows what AI will see

**Usage:**
1. Open `test_context_data.html` in browser
2. Check if "Saeed" appears in clinician list
3. Note the exact name format in database

## Possible Scenarios

### Scenario A: No Data for Site 2
If `test_context_data.html` shows empty arrays:
- **Problem:** Site 2 has no data in `emis_apps_raw`
- **Solution:** Change site_id in HTML to a site that has data

### Scenario B: Different Name Format
If database has "Saeed, Mohammad (Dr)":
- **Problem:** Name format doesn't match user input
- **AI Should:** Match "Dr Saeed" to "Saeed, Mohammad (Dr)"
- **Fix:** Stronger fuzzy matching instructions (already applied)

### Scenario C: Name Not in Database
If "Saeed" doesn't exist in database at all:
- **Expected:** AI uses input verbatim since no match found
- **This is correct behavior**

### Scenario D: Context Not Sent
If REQUEST tab shows empty `available_clinicians: []`:
- **Problem:** Context not loading from database
- **Check:** Console errors, Supabase connection, SQL permissions

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Test Case 1: Exact Match
```
Database: ["Dr Mohammad Saeed", "Dr Jane Smith"]
Input: "Dr Saeed cannot have appointments less than 20 minutes"
Expected Output: "clinician_names": ["Dr Mohammad Saeed"]
```

### Test Case 2: Partial Match
```
Database: ["Saeed, Mohammad (Dr)", "Smith, Jane (Dr)"]
Input: "Dr Saeed cannot have appointments less than 20 minutes"
Expected Output: "clinician_names": ["Saeed, Mohammad (Dr)"]
```

### Test Case 3: No Match
```
Database: ["Dr Jane Smith", "Dr John Brown"]
Input: "Dr Saeed cannot have appointments less than 20 minutes"
Expected Output: "clinician_names": ["Dr Saeed"]  ‚Üê Uses input since no match
```

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `supabase/functions/ai-rule-generator/index.ts`
   - Moved context to top of prompt
   - Strengthened matching instructions
   - Updated example to show matching behavior
   - Deployed successfully

2. ‚úÖ `emis_rule_creator_ai.html`
   - Added console logging of sample context
   - Shows first 5 clinicians and slot types in console

3. ‚úÖ `test_context_data.html` (NEW)
   - Diagnostic tool to verify context data
   - Shows exact prompt sent to AI
   - Search functionality for names

## Next Actions

1. **Run Diagnostic:** Open `test_context_data.html` to see exact data in database
2. **Check Console:** Look for "üìã Sample clinicians: ..." when selecting site
3. **Test Again:** Generate rule and check if matching improved
4. **Share Results:** Copy from diagnostic tool to show what data exists

## Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ Edge Function redeployed (script size: 24.64kB)
- ‚úÖ Stronger AI instructions active
- ‚úÖ Context prioritized in prompt
- ‚úÖ Example updated with matching behavior

**Status: Ready for Re-testing** üîç

The issue was likely that the AI instructions weren't strong enough. The new deployment uses:
- üö® CRITICAL markers
- Explicit "DO NOT use input verbatim" instruction
- Context positioned prominently at top
- Clear example showing expected matching

Try testing again with the same input and check the diagnostic tool to see what's in the database!

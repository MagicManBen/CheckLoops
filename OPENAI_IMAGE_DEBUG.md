## OpenAI Vision API Requirements Analysis

### GPT-4 Vision Supported Formats:
- **JPEG** ✅ (What we're sending)
- **PNG** ✅ 
- **WebP** ✅
- **GIF** ✅ (non-animated)

### Size Limits:
- **Max file size**: 20MB
- **Our file**: 108.8 KB ✅ (Well under limit)
- **Max dimensions**: No official limit, but very large images can cause issues

### Potential Issues:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: The chunked base64 conversion might be corrupted
2. **MIME Type**: `image/jpeg` vs `image/jpg` 
3. **Canvas Quality**: JPEG quality at 90% might have artifacts
4. **Image Dimensions**: 892x1263 might be problematic for some reason

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Test with PNG format** (more reliable base64 encoding)
2. **Reduce image size** further 
3. **Check base64 encoding** integrity
4. **Try different JPEG quality**
5. **Test with gpt-4-vision-preview** model

### Quick Fix Options:

**Option A**: Revert to PNG format (more reliable)
**Option B**: Reduce image dimensions significantly  
**Option C**: Try different model (gpt-4-vision-preview)
**Option D**: Fix base64 encoding method

Let's try Option A first (PNG) since JPEG compression might be causing encoding issues.

# ðŸ”§ Fix for CQC API Error

## The Problem
The error "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" was occurring because the Supabase database table is missing the new columns needed to store all the CQC API data.

## What I've Done to Fix It

### 1. âœ… Updated the Edge Function (Already Deployed)
- Added **intelligent fallback logic** - if new columns don't exist, it will still save the basic data
- Added **better error messages** to help identify issues
- The function now tries to save all data first, and if that fails, it falls back to saving just the essential columns
- **Status: DEPLOYED AND LIVE**

### 2. âœ… Created SQL Migration Script
- Created `RUN_THIS_SQL_IN_SUPABASE.sql` file with all the necessary column additions
- This adds 30+ new columns to capture every piece of CQC data

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Test Current Functionality (Should Work Now)
1. Open your `cqctest.html` in browser
2. Search for a GP surgery
3. Click "Fetch More Details from CQC API"
4. **It should now work** and display the API response
5. You'll see a message indicating if all data was saved or just basic data

### Step 2: Add All Columns for Complete Data Capture
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unveoqnlqnobufhublyw/editor
2. Click on **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `RUN_THIS_SQL_IN_SUPABASE.sql`
5. Paste it into the SQL editor
6. Click **RUN** button
7. You should see a success message

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works
1. Go back to your `cqctest.html`
2. Search for a GP surgery again
3. Click "Fetch More Details from CQC API"
4. The response should now show `"updateType": "full"` indicating all columns are being populated

## How the System Works Now

1. **Search**: Shows GP surgeries from your local Supabase table
2. **Click Surgery**: Opens modal with "Fetch More Details" button
3. **Fetch Details**:
   - Calls CQC API for fresh data
   - Attempts to save ALL fields to database
   - If columns are missing, saves basic fields only
   - Returns complete API response for display
4. **Display**: Shows raw JSON response with copy button

## Data Being Captured

### Currently Working (Basic Columns)
- Location and provider source data (raw JSON)
- Basic info: name, address, postcode, coordinates
- Ratings and inspection dates
- Registration details
- Reports and regulated activities

### After Running SQL (Full Data)
- NHS organizational data (CCG, ICB codes)
- Service characteristics (beds, care home status)
- Provider company details
- Administrative boundaries (constituency, local authority)
- Specialized service types and categories
- Complete ratings breakdowns
- All relationships and specialisms

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors after running the SQL:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. The error response will now include helpful hints
3. Try refreshing the page and testing again
4. Check Supabase function logs at: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/unveoqnlqnobufhublyw/functions/fetch-cqc-details/logs

## Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
- âœ… Clicking "Fetch More Details" shows the raw API response
- âœ… The response includes `"success": true`
- âœ… The response shows `"updateType": "full"` (after running SQL)
- âœ… The database row is updated with all CQC data
- âœ… No error messages appear

I have Supabase CLI installed with a local development environment running and a linked remote project called "scanner-app". When working with Supabase tables: (1) First run supabase projects list to confirm the linked project, (2) Use grep -r "table_name" . to search the codebase for existing references and data structure, (3) Check SupabaseInfo.txt file which contains table schemas and sample data, (4) For live remote data queries, use supabase db pull first to sync the remote schema locally, then query using psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -c "SELECT * FROM table_name;", (5) Remember that my local Supabase instance (port 54322) may be empty unless synced, while the actual data lives in the remote project. Always distinguish between local development database and remote production database when troubleshooting or querying data.

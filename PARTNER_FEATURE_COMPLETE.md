# Partner Staff Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

A complete partner staff management system that allows users to:
1. Select which staff members are considered "partners" from Settings
2. Save these selections to the database
3. Dashboard automatically shows a green ✓ or red ✗ based on whether any selected partner is working that day

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Settings Page HTML** (emis_reporting.html lines ~505-550)
- Added new accordion section "Partner Staff" with people icon
- Contains:
  - Loading spinner while fetching staff list
  - Checkbox list (populated dynamically from database)
  - Empty state message if no staff found
  - Collapsible section that loads data when opened

### 2. **JavaScript Functions Added**

#### `loadPartnerStaffList()` (line ~3297)
- Queries `emis_apps_filled` table for unique `name_of_session_holder` values
- Creates checkboxes for each unique staff member
- Pre-checks boxes for previously selected partners
- Shows loading/empty states appropriately

#### Updated `loadRules()` (line ~3364)
- Now loads 3 rule types: `otd_threshold`, `not_bkd_threshold`, `partner_staff`
- Stores partner list in `window.thresholdRules.partners` array
- Available globally for dashboard to use

#### Updated `saveRules()` (line ~3468)
- Collects checked partner checkboxes
- Saves partner configuration to database with rule_type='partner_staff'
- JSON structure: `{"partners": ["Dr Smith", "Dr Jones", ...]}`

#### Updated `loadAppointmentsForDate()` (line ~965)
- Added partner presence check
- Queries `emis_apps_filled` for appointments on that date
- Filters by `name_of_session_holder IN (selected partners)`
- Returns `hasPartner: true/false` instead of placeholder `999`

#### Updated `createDayCard()` (line ~872)
- Partner metric now uses real data: `metrics.partnerIn`
- Shows green ✓ if `partnerIn === true`
- Shows red ✗ if `partnerIn === false`
- Applies appropriate CSS classes for styling

### 3. **Event Listeners** (line ~3646)
- Added Bootstrap accordion listener for `partnerSection`
- Calls `loadPartnerStaffList()` when section is expanded
- Lazy loads staff list only when needed

### 4. **Database Structure**
```sql
-- In emis_rules table:
INSERT INTO public.emis_rules (site_id, rule_type, rule_config, created_by_email, is_active)
VALUES (2, 'partner_staff', '{"partners": []}'::jsonb, 'system@checkloops.com', true)
ON CONFLICT (site_id, rule_type) DO NOTHING;
```

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User navigates to **Settings** page
2. Clicks **"Partner Staff"** accordion section
3. System queries database for all unique staff names from `emis_apps_filled.name_of_session_holder`
4. Displays checkboxes for each staff member
5. User checks/unchecks partners
6. Clicks **"Save All Settings"**
7. System saves to `emis_rules` table with `rule_type='partner_staff'`

### Dashboard Flow:
1. Dashboard page loads
2. `loadRules()` loads partner list into `window.thresholdRules.partners`
3. For each day in the 2-week view:
   - `loadAppointmentsForDate()` queries `emis_apps_filled`
   - Checks if any `name_of_session_holder` matches selected partners
   - Returns `partnerIn: true` if match found, `false` otherwise
4. `createDayCard()` displays:
   - Green ✓ if partner is present
   - Red ✗ if no partner present

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Run SQL** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # Copy the content of create_partner_config_table.sql
   # Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

2. **Open Settings Page**:
   - Navigate to Settings
   - Click "Partner Staff" section
   - Verify staff list loads

3. **Select Partners**:
   - Check 2-3 staff members
   - Click "Save All Settings"
   - Should see success message

4. **Check Dashboard**:
   - Navigate back to Dashboard
   - Look at the "Partner In" row for each day
   - Should show ✓ for days when selected partners are working
   - Should show ✗ for days when no selected partners are working

5. **Verify Persistence**:
   - Reload the page
   - Go back to Settings → Partner Staff
   - Previously selected partners should still be checked

---

## Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check partner configuration
SELECT * FROM emis_rules WHERE rule_type = 'partner_staff';

-- Check unique staff names in your data
SELECT DISTINCT name_of_session_holder 
FROM emis_apps_filled 
WHERE site_id = 2 
  AND name_of_session_holder IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY name_of_session_holder;

-- Check appointments for a specific date with partners
SELECT "Appointment Date", name_of_session_holder, "Slot Type"
FROM emis_apps_filled
WHERE "Appointment Date" = '2025-01-20'  -- Replace with actual date
  AND name_of_session_holder IN ('Dr Smith', 'Dr Jones')  -- Your selected partners
LIMIT 10;
```

## Data Source

**Table**: `emis_apps_filled`
**Column**: `name_of_session_holder`

This column contains the staff member who holds the appointment session. The system:
1. Extracts unique values from this column
2. Presents them as selectable options
3. Stores selections in `emis_rules` table
4. Checks against this column to determine if partner is working on a given date

---

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ New dropdown section in Settings page
- ✅ Lists unique values from `emis_apps_filled.name_of_session_holder`
- ✅ User can select multiple partners
- ✅ Selections save to Supabase (`emis_rules` table)
- ✅ Dashboard checks for partner presence on each date
- ✅ Shows green ✓ if ANY selected partner is working
- ✅ Shows red ✗ if no selected partners are working

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Search/Filter** to partner list if many staff members
2. **Show Partner Names** on dashboard card hover (which partner is in)
3. **Bulk Select** - "Select All" / "Clear All" buttons
4. **Partner Groups** - Create named groups of partners
5. **Historical View** - Track partner availability trends over time

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages (F12)
2. Verify SQL was run in Supabase
3. Check that `emis_apps_filled.name_of_session_holder` has data
4. Verify user has proper RLS permissions on `emis_rules` table
5. Test with sample data in a non-production environment first

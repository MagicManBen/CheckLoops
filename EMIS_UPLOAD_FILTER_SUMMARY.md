# EMIS Upload Filter - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Solution Implemented

**Your data is now deduplicated automatically!**

All CSV uploads are preserved in the database, but only the most recent upload is displayed in the HTML dashboard.

---

## 📋 Quick Start

### 1. Run the SQL Script (Required)
```sql
-- Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```
Copy and paste the entire contents of `EMIS_LATEST_UPLOAD_VIEW.sql`

### 2. Refresh the Page
The changes take effect immediately - just refresh your browser.

## 🔧 What Changed

### Database (SQL):
- ✅ Updated `emis_apps_filled` view to filter by latest `created_at` timestamp
- ✅ Created `emis_apps_raw_latest` view for raw data access
- ✅ All historical uploads remain intact in `emis_apps_raw`

### HTML (Minimal):
- ✅ Updated 2 functions to query only the latest upload:
  - `loadUniqueSlotTypes()` - for appointment type setup
  - `loadContextData()` - for AI rules generation
- ✅ All dashboard queries already use `emis_apps_filled` (no changes needed)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Before:
```
Upload 1 (100 rows) ──┐
Upload 2 (100 rows) ──┼─→ Dashboard shows 200 rows ❌
Upload 3 (100 rows) ──┘
```

### After:
```
Upload 1 (100 rows) ──┐
Upload 2 (100 rows) ──┼─→ Dashboard shows 100 rows ✅
Upload 3 (100 rows) ──┘   (only latest upload)
                      ↓
              All kept in database
              for historical comparison
```

---

## 📊 Testing

1. **Upload a CSV** - Check the dashboard shows the data
2. **Upload another CSV** - Dashboard updates to show only the new data
3. **Verify in SQL**:
   ```sql
   -- See all uploads
   SELECT created_at, COUNT(*) 
   FROM emis_apps_raw 
   GROUP BY created_at 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   
   -- See what's displayed
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emis_apps_filled;
   ```

---

## 🔍 Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything is working:

```sql
-- 1. Check how many uploads you have
SELECT 
    created_at,
    COUNT(*) as records,
    MIN(appointment_date) as earliest,
    MAX(appointment_date) as latest
FROM emis_apps_raw
GROUP BY created_at
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 2. Verify only latest is shown
SELECT 
    created_at,
    COUNT(*) as displayed_records
FROM emis_apps_filled
GROUP BY created_at;

-- 3. Compare all vs latest
SELECT 
    'All Uploads' as source,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM emis_apps_raw

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Latest Only' as source,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM emis_apps_filled;
```

## 🔄 Historical Comparison

To compare uploads over time:

```sql
-- Compare appointments between two specific uploads
SELECT 
    created_at,
    "Appointment Date",
    COUNT(*) as appointments
FROM emis_apps_filled_all  -- View showing ALL data
WHERE created_at IN (
    '2025-10-22 10:30:00+00',
    '2025-10-22 14:45:00+00'
)
GROUP BY created_at, "Appointment Date"
ORDER BY "Appointment Date", created_at;
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Non-destructive** - All historical data is preserved
2. **Automatic** - No manual filtering needed
3. **Transparent** - The latest upload is always shown
4. **Reversible** - Can be rolled back if needed (see `REVERT_ALL_VERSIONING.sql`)

---

## ✅ Status

**Implementation:** Complete  
**Testing Required:** Yes (run SQL, test upload, verify)  
**Breaking Changes:** None  
**Data Loss Risk:** None (all data preserved)

---

## 📞 Support

If the dashboard still shows duplicates after running the SQL:
1. Check the verification queries above
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Verify the SQL ran without errors
4. Check that `emis_apps_filled` view was recreated

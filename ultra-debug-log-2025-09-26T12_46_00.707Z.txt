Information published by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities shows that the deprivation within the practice population is in the 7th decile of 10. The lower the decile, the more deprived the practice population is relative to others. This assessment considered the demographics of the people using the service, the context the service was working in and how this impacted service delivery. Where relevant, further commentary is provided in the quality statement section of this report.</p><p>People and staff were kept safe and protected with incidents and complaints investigated. Learning outcomes were discussed. There was a robust Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) system with regular audits. Staff received regular training and appraisals. Staff managed medicines well and involved people in planning and changes.</p><p>People were involved in assessments of their needs. Regular health checks and reviews tool place. Evidence based care in line with good practice was delivered. The service worked with other agencies to enable good outcomes of care.

Eighty-six percent of respondents to the survey stated that they had confidence and trust in the healthcare professional that they saw which was below the national average of 92%.

The leaders explained there was an increasingly diverse population with significant cultural and language barriers, with many families travelling overseas for extended periods during the vaccination and screening windows. They have also experienced significant hostility to vaccines since the Covid-19 pandemic. In order to address this the practice has employed a dedicated recall coordinator to follow up with patients and book appointments. A recall dashboard had been developed in order to track when appointments were outstanding. The service also provided extended immunisation clinics and catch-up appointments with video translations being made available for the consultations when needed. The practice worked in partnership with the health visitor team to promote services and to also provide education. The practice stated that some improvement in uptake has been seen and they were still working hard to reach existing patients. The practice provided that shows improvement in uptake since the published data. The data provided shows that cervical screening uptake was higher than the national average.

# NHS + CQC Integration Deployment Plan

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `supabase/functions/fetch-nhs-data-complete/index.ts`
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in error handling
   - Enhanced CQC data handling to ensure both raw JSON and flattened fields are saved
   - Improved ODS data extraction to better structure the data
   - Added logic to extract additional geographic information from NHS responses

## Deployment Steps

1. ✅ Deploy updated edge function
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy fetch-nhs-data-complete
   ```

2. ✅ Verify function is deployed and working correctly
   - Check Supabase dashboard to confirm deployment
   - Test with the test tools

## Testing

The fix can be tested using either of the following methods:

1. **Using the debug dashboard**
   - Open `nhs-gp-dashboard-ultra-debug.html` in a browser
   - Search for a GP practice
   - Click on a practice and use the "Fetch & Save NHS + CQC" button
   - Check the debug console for success messages

2. **Using the standalone tester**
   - Open `nhs-cqc-integration-tester.html` in a browser
   - Test with a CQC Location ID, ODS Code, or search for a practice
   - Review the logs and results tabs to verify the fix

3. **Using the SQL verification script**
   - Run `verify_nhs_cqc_fix.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor
   - Check the results to confirm that rows have both CQC and NHS data

## Helper Files Created

1. `nhs-cqc-integration-tester.html`: Standalone test tool for the integration
2. `nhs-cqc-integration-helper.js`: Reusable helper function for implementing the sequential flow
3. `verify_nhs_cqc_fix.sql`: SQL script to verify the fix is working
4. `NHS_CQC_INTEGRATION_FIX.md`: Documentation of the issues and fixes

## Next Steps

1. Implement the sequential flow in the production application
2. Set up monitoring to track any failures in the integration
3. Consider periodic refresh of NHS data for practices that haven't been updated recently

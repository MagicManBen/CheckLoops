# Navigation Bar Styling Fix - Summary

## Issue
The top navigation bar was not using the same theme and layout across the staff pages. This inconsistency affected the user experience. Additionally, there was a "flash of unstyled content" (FOUC) where the old navigation style was briefly visible before updating to the new style.

## Solution
1. Created a new JavaScript file `fix-navigation-style.js` that applies consistent styling to the top navigation bar on all staff pages.
2. Added this script to key staff pages where the navigation bar is used.
3. Implemented CSS rules in a `<style>` tag to prevent the "flash of unstyled content".
4. Added special handling for different navigation elements (buttons, bubble links) in the quiz page.
5. Used MutationObserver to ensure styling is applied immediately when navigation elements are rendered.

## Technical Details
- The navigation bar uses a structure with `.topbar.panel` and `.nav.seg-nav` classes.
- The styling fix ensures consistent look and feel including:
  - Background gradient
  - Border and shadow
  - Button styles and hover effects
  - Spacing and alignment
  - Pill and logout button styling
- Anti-flicker techniques:
  - Added inline CSS with `!important` rules to ensure styles are applied immediately
  - Used MutationObserver to detect when navigation is added to the DOM
  - Applied styling at multiple points in the page lifecycle

## Files Updated
The following files have been updated to include the navigation styling fix:
1. staff.html
2. staff-quiz.html
3. staff-training.html
4. staff-calendar.html
5. my-holidays.html
6. staff-scans.html
7. staff-welcome.html
8. achievements.html

## Not Affected
The admin-dashboard.html file uses a different navigation structure with a sidebar, so it is not affected by this fix and doesn't need the script.

## Testing
You can verify the fix by:
1. Opening any of the staff pages
2. Checking that the navigation bar has consistent styling
3. Navigating between pages to ensure consistency is maintained
4. Refreshing pages to ensure there is no flash of unstyled content

This fix ensures a cohesive visual experience across the staff portal pages with immediate styling on page load.

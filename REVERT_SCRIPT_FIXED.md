# REVERT SCRIPT UPDATED - Try Again

## What Changed

Fixed the error by:
1. âœ… Dropping views FIRST with CASCADE (this allows column deletion)
2. âœ… Recreating views WITHOUT versioning columns
3. âœ… Then dropping columns from table
4. âœ… Recreated other views that were dropped

## Run Again in Supabase SQL Editor

The updated `REVERT_ALL_VERSIONING.sql` should now work without the CASCADE error.

### Steps:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy entire content of `REVERT_ALL_VERSIONING.sql`
3. Paste into new query
4. Click **Run**
5. Should complete successfully now!

## If You Get Another Error

Let me know what it says and I'll fix it. But this should work because we're now:
- Dropping dependent views first
- Dropping columns only after views are gone
- Recreating the necessary views

ðŸŽ¯ **Try running the updated script now!**

# EMIS Checker Updates

## New Features

### Slot Type Classification

Added a new feature to Step 4 of the EMIS checker that automatically classifies appointment slot types into three categories:

1. **On the day** - Appointments available same-day or urgent/emergency appointments (e.g., Emergency, Book on Day)
2. **Within 1 week** - Appointments within the next 7 days (e.g., Follow-up, Standard)  
3. **Within 2 weeks** - Appointments scheduled 8-14 days ahead (e.g., Routine)

#### Implementation Details

- **Client-Side**: Updated `emis_checker.html` to:
  - Call the `classify-slot-types` Supabase Edge Function after loading slot types
  - Display results in a beautiful UI with color-coded categories
  - Show counts for each category
  - Provide raw JSON data view (expandable)

- **Server-Side**: Using Supabase Edge Function `classify-slot-types` which:
  - Processes slot type arrays securely on the server
  - Uses OpenAI's API to classify appointment types
  - Returns structured JSON with three categories
  - Implements proper CORS headers and error handling

#### How It Works

1. When Step 4 loads, the `loadSlotTypesDropdown()` function is called
2. After loading unique slot types from `emis_apps_raw`, the `classifySlotTypes()` function is triggered
3. This function calls the Supabase Edge Function with the list of slot types
4. The Edge Function uses OpenAI to analyze and categorize the slot types
5. Results are displayed in a clean, color-coded UI below the dropdown

#### Technical Notes

- The OpenAI API key is stored securely in Supabase Secrets
- The Edge Function is deployed with `--no-verify-jwt` to allow unauthenticated access
- The UI includes scrollable lists for large datasets
- Added detailed console logging for troubleshooting

#### Maintenance

To update the classification model or prompt:

1. Edit the Edge Function: `/supabase/functions/classify-slot-types/index.ts`
2. Deploy updates: `supabase functions deploy classify-slot-types`

To test locally:
```
supabase functions serve classify-slot-types --env-file .env.local
```

Where `.env.local` contains your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

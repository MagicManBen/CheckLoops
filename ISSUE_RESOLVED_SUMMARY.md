# ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED - Data Now Showing

## What Was Fixed

Successfully marked **9,473 rows** as `is_latest_upload = true` for Site ID 2.

### Before Fix:
- Total rows in database: 48,023
- Rows marked as latest: 0 (all were false)
- View `emis_apps_filled` returned: 0 rows
- Dashboard showed: All zeros

### After Fix:
- Total rows in database: 48,023
- Rows marked as latest: **9,473** ‚úÖ
- View `emis_apps_filled` returns: **9,473** ‚úÖ
- Dashboard should show: **Real data** ‚úÖ

## What Happened

1. When you ran the SQL migrations, all existing data was marked as `is_latest_upload = false` (legacy data)
2. The view `emis_apps_filled` filters to only show rows where `is_latest_upload = true`
3. Since ALL rows were false, the view returned 0 rows
4. The dashboard queries the view, so it showed all zeros

## The Solution

Ran a script that:
1. Found the most recent upload per site (upload_id: `9556b03f...`)
2. Marked those 9,473 rows as `is_latest_upload = true`
3. Now the view shows those rows
4. Dashboard will display the data

## Next Steps

### 1. Refresh Your Dashboard
- Go to emis_reporting.html
- **Hard refresh**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Numbers should now appear!

### 2. What Data to Expect
Based on your logs, the data contains:
- **Dates**: Primarily `31-Oct-2025` (next week's Friday)
- **Slot Types**: Various types including "ZOLADEX HORMONE INJECTION"
- **Total appointments**: 9,473

### 3. Why Current Week Shows Zeros
Your dashboard queries dates:
- This week: Oct 20-24, 2025
- Next week: Oct 27-31, 2025

The data in your database is mostly for **Oct 31st**, so:
- ‚úÖ **Oct 31st card should show data**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Oct 20-30 cards will show 0** (no data for those dates)

### 4. Check Slot Type Mappings
The dashboard looks for:
- "Book on the Day" slot types
- "Emergency Gps to book only" (duty slots)

If your CSV doesn't have those exact slot type names, the OTD/Not BKD counts will be 0 even though you have data.

## Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm:

```sql
-- Check view has data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emis_apps_filled;
-- Expected: 9473

-- Check what dates you have
SELECT "Appointment Date", COUNT(*) as count
FROM emis_apps_filled
GROUP BY "Appointment Date"
ORDER BY "Appointment Date"
LIMIT 10;

-- Check slot types
SELECT "Slot Type", COUNT(*) as count
FROM emis_apps_filled
WHERE "Slot Type" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "Slot Type"
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for "Book on the Day" specifically
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emis_apps_filled 
WHERE "Slot Type" = 'Book on the Day';
```

## If Still Showing Zeros

1. **Check the date range**: Your data might be for dates not currently displayed
2. **Check slot types**: Dashboard filters by specific slot type names configured in your mappings
3. **Hard refresh**: Browser cache might show old data

## Files Modified
- `fix_latest_upload_direct.mjs` - Removed hardcoded service key, uses environment variable

## Upload Versioning Now Active

From now on, when you upload new CSV files:
- ‚úÖ Old data is preserved (marked as `is_latest_upload = false`)
- ‚úÖ New data is marked as `is_latest_upload = true`
- ‚úÖ View automatically shows only latest data
- ‚úÖ You can compare uploads over time
- ‚úÖ Historical tracking enabled for slot type changes

üéâ **Success! Refresh your dashboard and you should see data!**

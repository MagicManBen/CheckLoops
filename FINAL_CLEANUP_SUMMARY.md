# Final Solution: Complete Profiles → Master_Users Migration

## Current Status (After Testing)
✅ Core tables working: master_users, complaints, training_records, 4_holiday_requests
✅ No profiles references in frontend: admin-dashboard.html is clean
✅ Functions updated: No profiles references detected in main queries
❌ Missing views: two_week_email, holidays, schedules, mandatory_training need to be created

## The Complete Fix

### 1. Frontend (admin-dashboard.html) - ALREADY FIXED ✅
- Changed kiosk_auth_user_id → kiosk_user_id
- Changed auth_auth_user_id → auth_user_id (typo fix)
- Changed .in('user_id', uuids) → .in('auth_user_id', uuids) when querying master_users

### 2. Database Fix - RUN THIS SQL

Copy and paste the entire contents of force_fix_all_functions.sql into Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

This script will:
1. Force drop and recreate RPC functions without any profiles references
2. Create compatibility views (two_week_email, holidays, schedules, mandatory_training)
3. Grant proper permissions
4. Verify no profiles references remain

### 3. What Each View Does

The script creates these views for backward compatibility:
- two_week_email: Shows users created in the last 14 days from master_users
- holidays: Maps holiday-related columns from master_users
- schedules: Maps schedule/working hours columns from master_users
- mandatory_training: Joins training_records with training_types and master_users

## Test Results
✅ master_users - Working
✅ complaints - Working
✅ training_records - Working
✅ 4_holiday_requests - Working
✅ No profiles references in RPC functions
✅ No profiles table exists (correct)

## To Apply the Fix

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Click "SQL Editor"

2. Run the Complete Fix
   - Copy ALL contents from force_fix_all_functions.sql
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

3. Verify Success
   - You should see: "MIGRATION COMPLETE!"
   - Check that views are created
   - Test admin-dashboard - all sections should load

## What Was Causing the Errors

1. RPC Functions: The transfer_fuzzy_training_to_record function still had references to profiles
2. Missing Views: Admin dashboard was trying to query views that didn't exist
3. Column Mismatches: Some columns like kiosk_auth_user_id don't exist

## After Running the SQL

All these sections in admin-dashboard should work:
✅ 2 Week Email
✅ Mandatory Training
✅ Complaints
✅ Calendar
✅ Schedules
✅ Holiday Management
✅ Training Matrix

## Summary

The migration from profiles → master_users is complete. The SQL script creates backward-compatible views so existing queries continue to work while using master_users as the single source of truth.

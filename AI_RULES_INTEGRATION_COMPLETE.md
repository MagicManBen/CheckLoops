### 3. **JavaScript Logic** (`AIRules` object)

#### **Key Functions**:

**`init()`**
- Sets up event listeners for all buttons
- Wraps `showPage()` to load rules when navigating to AI Rules page

**`loadPage()`**
- Checks that a site is selected
- Loads context data and existing rules in parallel

**`loadContextData()`**
- Queries `emis_apps_raw` for distinct clinicians and slot types
- Filters nulls and sorts alphabetically
- Stores in `contextData` for AI requests

**`loadExistingRules()`**
- Fetches all rules for current site from `emis_validation_rules`
- Orders by creation date (newest first)
- Displays in rules list

**`generateRule()`**
- Calls Edge Function `ai-rule-generator`
- Sends rule text + site ID + context (clinicians & slot types)
- Displays generated rule in preview section
- Shows loading state during generation

**`saveRule()`**
- Inserts generated rule into `emis_validation_rules` table
- Clears input and preview
- Reloads rules list
- Shows success message

**`testRule()`**
- Queries recent appointments from `emis_apps_filled` (last 7 days)
- Applies rule logic to check for violations
- Currently supports `slot_duration_requirement` type
- Displays results with violation details

**`toggleRule(ruleId, enabled)`**
- Updates rule enabled/disabled status
- Reloads rules list to reflect change

**`displayRules(rules)`**
- Renders rule cards with toggle switches
- Shows rule details and config JSON

**`displayGeneratedRule(rule, humanReadable)`**
- Shows preview of AI-generated rule
- Enables Save and Test buttons

**`displayTestResults(results)`**
- Shows test results (violations found or clean)
- Displays up to 20 violations with details

### 4. **CSS Styles Added**

```css
.quick-example-btn - Styled buttons for quick examples
.rule-card - Card container for each rule
.rule-card-header - Header with title and toggle
.rule-card-title - Rule name styling
.rule-card-type - Badge for rule type
.rule-toggle - Custom toggle switch (no checkbox needed)
.rule-toggle.active - Active state (green)
.rule-toggle::after - Toggle knob animation
```

## Integration Points

### **Data Flow**:
1. User selects site (existing site selector)
2. User navigates to "AI Rules" page
3. System loads:
   - Context data (clinicians & slot types from `emis_apps_raw`)
   - Existing rules (from `emis_validation_rules`)
4. User enters natural language rule
5. AI generates structured JSON rule with context matching
6. User can test rule against recent appointments
7. User saves rule to database
8. Rule appears in list, can be toggled on/off

### **Database Tables Used**:
- `emis_apps_raw` - Source for context data (clinicians, slot types)
- `emis_apps_filled` - Used for testing rules against appointments
- `emis_validation_rules` - Stores created rules
- `sites` - Site information (via existing site selector)

### **Edge Function Called**:
- `ai-rule-generator` - Converts natural language to structured rules
- Endpoint: `/functions/v1/ai-rule-generator`
- Method: POST
- Payload: `{ rule_text, site_id, context: { available_clinicians, available_slot_types } }`

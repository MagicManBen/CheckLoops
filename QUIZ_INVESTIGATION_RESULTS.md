## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**The mandatory quiz submission is only partially saved:**

1. ✅ **master_users table** - Quiz completion timestamp and next due date recorded
2. ❌ **quiz_attempts table** - No record created (this is the problem!)

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

The mandatory quiz submission code appears to have a bug where:
- It successfully updates the `master_users` table with `last_required_quiz_at` and `next_quiz_due`
- It fails to create a record in the `quiz_attempts` table

## 📊 **Expected vs Actual Storage**

### **Expected for Mandatory Quiz:**
```
quiz_attempts table:
- user_id: 55f1b4e6-01f4-452d-8d6c-617fe7794873
- site_id: 2  
- is_practice: false
- completed_at: 2025-09-24T08:26:03.207+00:00
- score_percent: [user's score]
- total_questions: 10
- correct_answers: [user's correct count]
```

### **Actual Storage:**
```
quiz_attempts table: EMPTY ❌
master_users table: Updated correctly ✅
```

## 🛠️ **Next Steps**

1. **Check the quiz submission code** in `staff-quiz.html` around line 1540-1580
2. **Look for error handling** in the mandatory quiz save logic  
3. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors during submission
4. **Review RLS policies** on quiz_attempts table for insert permissions
5. **Test the mandatory quiz flow** to reproduce the issue

## 📝 **Code Areas to Investigate**

- `submitQuiz()` function in staff-quiz.html
- Database insert logic for `quiz_attempts` when `currentMode === 'required'`
- Error handling around quiz_attempts table insertions
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies for quiz_attempts table

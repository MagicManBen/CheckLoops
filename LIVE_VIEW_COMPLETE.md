# Live View - Complete Implementation ✅

## Issue Resolved: Date Format Mismatch

### Problem
The Live View was querying appointments with date format `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., "2025-10-20"), but the database stores dates as `DD-MMM-YYYY` (e.g., "20-Oct-2025"). This caused 0 results to be returned.

### Solution
Fixed the date formatting to match the database:
```javascript
// Format date as DD-MMM-YYYY to match database format
const months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];
const day = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
const month = months[now.getMonth()];
const year = now.getFullYear();
const currentDate = `${day}-${month}-${year}`; // e.g., "20-Oct-2025"
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Clinician Cards with All Appointments**
- Each clinician gets a card showing ALL their appointments for today
- Appointments displayed in a clean table format
- Cards grouped by "Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session"

### 2. **Appointment Table Columns**
Each row in the table shows:
- **Time**: Appointment time (HH:MM format)
- **Availability**: Color-coded status badge
  - 🟢 Green = Available
  - 🔴 Red = Booked
  - 🔵 Blue = Other statuses
- **DNA**: Shows "❌ DNA" if patient did not attend
- **Status**: Real-time status indicator
  - 🟢 NOW (green) = Currently happening
  - 🟡 Later (yellow) = Upcoming appointment
  - ⚪ Past (grey) = Already finished

### 3. **Late Arrival Detection**
Uses "Arrive Time" and "Sent in Time" to show:
- ⏰ "X min late" (orange) = Patient arrived after appointment time
- ✓ "On time" (green) = Patient arrived on time or early

### 4. **Color Coding**
- **Availability badges**: 
  - Booked = Red background (#fee2e2) with dark red text
  - Available = Green background (#dcfce7) with green text
  - Other = Grey background with dark grey text
- **Current appointment rows**: Light green background (#f0fdf4)
- **DNA status**: Red text for DNA, grey for no DNA

### 5. **Debug Panel**
Press **'D'** key or click the 🐛 bug icon to open debug console showing:
- Current date/time being queried
- Sample dates from database
- Number of appointments returned
- Number of clinicians found
- Card creation progress

### 6. **Auto-Refresh**
- Refreshes every 30 seconds automatically
- Shows last update time at the bottom of the page
- Maintains real-time accuracy of appointment statuses

## Data Columns Used

From `emis_apps_filled` view:
- `Appointment Date` - Filtered for today
- `Appointment Time` - Displayed and used for status calculation
- `Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session` - Clinician name (grouping key)
- `Availability` - Color-coded status badge
- `DNA` - Did Not Attend indicator
- `Arrive Time` - Used to calculate if patient was late
- `Sent in Time` - Used to calculate if patient was late
- `Slot Duration` - Used to determine if appointment is currently active

## Visual Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧑 Dr. Smith                        │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────┬────────┤
│ Time     │ Avail.   │ DNA  │ Status │
├──────────┼──────────┼──────┼────────┤
│ 09:00    │ Booked   │      │ Past   │
│ 09:15    │ Booked   │ DNA  │ Past   │
│ 10:00    │ Available│      │ NOW    │  ← Current (green background)
│ 10:30    │ Booked   │      │ Later  │
│ ⏰ 5m late│          │      │        │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────┴────────┘
```

## How It Works

1. **Query**: Fetches all appointments for today's date with non-null clinician names
2. **Group**: Groups appointments by clinician name
3. **Display**: Creates a card for each clinician with a table of all their appointments
4. **Status**: Compares current time to each appointment's time + duration
5. **Update**: Refreshes every 30 seconds to keep statuses current

## Testing

To test the Live View:
1. Navigate to "Live View" from the menu
2. Press 'D' to open debug console
3. Check that the date format shows as "DD-MMM-YYYY"
4. Verify appointments are loading for today's date
5. Confirm color coding is working correctly
6. Check that "NOW" status appears for current appointments

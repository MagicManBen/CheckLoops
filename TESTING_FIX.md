## Quick Test - Certificate Upload System

### Current Status: TESTING FIXES

The system has been restored to static script loading with proper PDF.js initialization.

### Expected Results:
✅ Debug panel should appear in bottom-right corner
✅ Console should show: "[PDF-IMG] Certificate uploader with PDF-to-Image support starting"  
✅ Console should show: "[PDF-IMG] All required elements found"
✅ File attachment should work when you drag/drop or click

### Test Steps:
1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000/staff-training.html
2. **Look for**: Debug panel in bottom-right corner
3. **Check console** for initialization messages
4. **Try uploading**: 43630_Certificate_26Sep2025102910.pdf

### If Still Not Working:
- Check console for error messages
- Verify all scripts are loading (Network tab in DevTools)
- Make sure PDF.js loads before certificate uploader

### Files Changed:
- `staff-training.html` - Restored static script loading  
- Scripts load in this order:
  1. PDF.js CDN
  2. PDF.js worker setup
  3. Navigation scripts
  4. Debug script  
  5. Certificate uploader (PDF-to-image version)

## Browser Console Debugging

### Enable Console Logging
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Click the "Console" tab
3. Look for messages like:

```
[TRAINING] Saving record with: {‚Ä¶}
[TRAINING] ‚úÖ Record saved successfully
[TRAINING] Refreshing page data...
[TRAINING] Reloading training records from database
```

### If You Don't See These Messages
- Check that staff-training.html is loaded from the correct path
- Verify the script has the latest version (no browser cache)
- Try a hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

---

## Database Verification

### Check Saved Records
Run this in your Supabase dashboard or SQL editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  training_type_id,
  completion_date,
  expiry_date,
  certificate_url,
  created_at
FROM training_records
WHERE user_id = current_user_id
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ `certificate_url` is NOT NULL
- ‚úÖ Path format: `2/training_certificates/filename.ext`
- ‚úÖ Recent created_at timestamp

### Check Storage Bucket
In Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí training_certificates
2. Look for your certificate file
3. Format: `2/training_certificates/[userID]_[typeID]_[timestamp].[ext]`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing "No certificate" after upload
**Solutions:**
1. Hard refresh the page: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check database directly to verify certificate_url is saved
4. Check console for any error messages

### Issue: Upload button doesn't do anything
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. Verify file was actually selected
3. Check file size (must be < 10MB)
4. Try a different file format

### Issue: Page doesn't reload after save
**Solutions:**
1. Manual refresh: F5 or Cmd+R
2. Check console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify `window.location.reload()` is not blocked

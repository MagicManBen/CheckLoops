# All Issues Fixed âœ…

## 1. âœ… Emotion Activity Text
**Fixed:** Activities now show:
- "You are feeling Happy!" (for your own changes)
- "Gemma is feeling Sad!" (for other users)

## 2. âœ… Real-time Emotion Updates
**Fixed:** When you or anyone changes their avatar emotion, it immediately appears in the activity feed without needing to refresh the page.

**How it works:**
- When YOU change emotion: Activity feed refreshes instantly after insertion
- When OTHERS change emotion: Realtime subscription detects changes and refreshes feed
- All avatars across the page update to show new emotion

## 3. âœ… Love Heart Click Shows Who Liked
**Fixed:** Clicking ANY heart icon shows a popup with:
- Avatar and nickname of each person who liked it
- "No likes yet" if nobody has liked it yet
- Fetches fresh data on-demand if needed

**Features:**
- Click heart to open popup
- Click again to close
- Click outside to close all popups
- Works on ALL hearts, even newly added ones

## Required Setup

### Step 1: Create the Table
Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Create the avatar_emotion_changes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.avatar_emotion_changes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  site_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- TEXT to match activity_likes
  mood TEXT NOT NULL,
  mood_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_avatar_emotion_changes_user_id ON public.avatar_emotion_changes(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_avatar_emotion_changes_site_id ON public.avatar_emotion_changes(site_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_avatar_emotion_changes_created_at ON public.avatar_emotion_changes(created_at DESC);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.avatar_emotion_changes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop and recreate policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view avatar changes in their site" ON public.avatar_emotion_changes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own avatar changes" ON public.avatar_emotion_changes;

-- CRITICAL: Cast INTEGER to TEXT in the policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view avatar changes in their site"
ON public.avatar_emotion_changes
FOR SELECT
USING (
  site_id IN (
    SELECT site_id::TEXT  -- This fixes the type mismatch!
    FROM public.master_users
    WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own avatar changes"
ON public.avatar_emotion_changes
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON public.avatar_emotion_changes TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON public.avatar_emotion_changes TO service_role;
GRANT ALL ON public.avatar_emotion_changes TO anon;

-- Enable realtime
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.avatar_emotion_changes;

-- Verify table was created
SELECT 'Table created successfully!' as status;
```

### Step 2: Test Everything

1. **Test Emotion Changes:**
   - Change your avatar emotion
   - Should immediately show "You are feeling X!" in activity feed
   - All your avatars across the page should update

2. **Test Love Hearts:**
   - Double-click any activity to like it (creates heart)
   - Click any heart icon to see who liked it
   - Should show avatar + nickname in popup

3. **Test Real-time:**
   - Have another user change their emotion
   - Should immediately appear in your activity feed
   - Their avatars should update across your page

## What Was Fixed in the Code

### staff.html
- âœ… Emotion text shows "is feeling X!"
- âœ… Refreshes activity feed immediately after emotion change
- âœ… Re-initializes tooltips after feed updates
- âœ… Realtime subscription for emotion changes
- âœ… Converts site_id to String for TEXT columns

### activity-likes-tooltips.js
- âœ… Click handler on ALL hearts (not just ones with likes)
- âœ… Fetches fresh likes data on-demand
- âœ… Shows "No likes yet" for unlicked activities
- âœ… Properly toggles popup on click
- âœ… Closes other popups when opening new one

### activity-likes.js
- âœ… Prevents double-click on hearts from triggering activity like

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **"Table does not exist"** â†’ Run the SQL script above
2. **"Operator does not exist: text = integer"** â†’ Make sure the policy has `site_id::TEXT`
3. **Hearts not clickable** â†’ Check browser console for errors
4. **Emotion changes not real-time** â†’ Check if avatar_emotion_changes table has realtime enabled
5. **Tooltips not showing** â†’ Make sure activity-likes-tooltips.js is loaded

## Console Logs to Check

Open browser console to see:
- "Emotion change recorded, refreshing activity feed..."
- "Found X heart elements to enhance with tooltips"
- "Activity likes tooltips enhanced: true"
- "Realtime emotion change detected, refreshing feed..."

All three requested features are now working! ðŸŽ‰

enforce a weekly, required staff quiz flow: each staff member should only be required to take the quiz once per week; when due the page should present a required quiz of 10 random questions, otherwise show a live countdown until the next required quiz; additionally there must be a Practice mode that lets staff take a quiz any time but does not record attempts in the database; and you asked me to inspect the Supabase schema to find where quiz submissions are stored and to add any missing database fields (notably a place to track the next due date per profile) using the Supabase CLI migration workflow, or else provide a single SQL you can run in Supabase if the CLI got stuck. To satisfy that we located the quiz front-end at staff-quiz.html and the Supabase schema snapshot; we implemented client-side behavior so the UI supports Practice mode (no DB writes), prepares a required flow that selects 10 random questions, renders progress and feedback, and contains submission logic that attempts to write a quiz_attempts row and to update profiles.next_quiz_due to seven days in the future. On the DB side I added a local migration to add-and-backfill profiles.next_quiz_due and attempted to reconcile and push migrations with the Supabase CLI, then created idempotent guards around RLS policies and unique-timestamped migration files and even a stub to match remote migration history when the push complained; when that proved fragile I also gave you a single safe SQL transaction you can paste into the Supabase SQL editor to add the column and backfill it immediately. What‚Äôs not working: first, the page currently contains a JavaScript syntax error (a stray token "stopke" inside fetchQuestions()), which prevents the script from running at all and blocks any quiz behavior on the site until removed; second, even after runtime fixes the client logic currently computes next-due from the last row in quiz_attempts rather than reading and preferring the server-side profiles.next_quiz_due value, so the server-side column (which your export shows does exist and already contains values) is effectively ignored by the UI; third, although submission code attempts to insert into quiz_attempts and update profiles.next_quiz_due, real-world application of the migration via the Supabase CLI was blocked by migration-history and RLS/policy conflicts on the remote (duplicate migration versions and an existing policy caused db push / migration repair to fail and produced duplicate-key and policy-already-exists errors), and attempts to inspect/repair the remote migration table were hampered by connection/auth issues in the debugging attempts; fourth, current DB snapshot evidence shows a small number of questions present but quiz_attempts rows are either missing user_id or are sparse, so existing data won‚Äôt reliably drive the client fallback logic. In short: the front-end logic to meet the requested weekly gating and practice modes is mostly present, but the immediate blockers are (A) fix the JS syntax error so the page runs, (B) change the client to prefer the server profiles.next_quiz_due when available, and (C) either run the single idempotent SQL I provided in the Supabase SQL editor to ensure the next_quiz_due column exists and is backfilled, or continue careful, manual reconciliation of local and remote Supabase migrations (which may require inspecting and editing the remote migration history table) so the CLI push can complete; once those issues are resolved a logged-in user should be able to take the required 10-question quiz, have the attempt recorded in quiz_attempts, and see their profiles.next_quiz_due updated for the weekly gating to reliably work. Remember to check in super bases and test anything and everything.

Found the syntax error on line 73. Let me fix it and update the client logic to properly use profiles.next_quiz_due:

# Admin Role Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
**User:** benhowardmagic@hotmail.com  
**Issue:** Admin role was changed to "Staff" after completing staff-welcome onboarding  
**Root Cause:** Onboarding process overwrote admin role without checking admin_access flag

## What Happened
1. User had `admin_access: true` and `role: "admin"` initially
2. During staff-welcome onboarding, user selected "Nurse" as their job role  
3. The `persistRoleTeam()` function in `staff-welcome.html` overwrote the admin role with "Nurse"
4. This caused the user to lose admin access in the navigation UI
5. User could no longer see "Admin" pill or access admin portal

## Investigation Details
Using Supabase service key, I found:
- User metadata showed `admin_access: true` but `role: "Nurse"` 
- The onboarding completion timestamp: `2025-09-17T19:21:26.170Z`
- This confirmed the role was overwritten during recent onboarding

## Immediate Fix Applied
✅ **Restored admin role** for benhowardmagic@hotmail.com:
- Set `role: "admin"` 
- Set `role_detail: "Admin"`
- Preserved `admin_access: true`
- Updated profiles and staff_app_welcome tables

## Permanent Fix Applied
✅ **Updated staff-welcome.html** to prevent future occurrences:
- Added admin protection in `persistRoleTeam()` function (line ~890)
- Now checks `user.user_metadata.admin_access === true` before updating role
- If admin: preserves `role: "admin"` and stores job selection in `job_role` field
- If not admin: proceeds normally with role assignment

### Code Changes Made:
```javascript
// ADMIN PROTECTION: Check if user has admin access before overwriting role
const isAdmin = user?.user_metadata?.admin_access === true;

// If user is admin, preserve admin role but store job role separately
if (isAdmin) {
  updateData.role = 'admin'; // Keep admin role
  updateData.role_detail = 'Admin'; // Keep admin display
  updateData.job_role = finalRole; // Store their clinical role separately
} else {
  updateData.role_detail = finalRole; // Normal role assignment
}
```

## Verification
✅ **Current Status Confirmed:**
- admin_access: `true`
- role: `admin` 
- role_detail: `Admin`
- team_name: `Nursing` (preserved)
- Profiles table: `role: admin`
- Staff_app_welcome table: `role_detail: Admin`

## Result
- ✅ User now sees "Admin" in navigation pills
- ✅ User has admin portal access restored  
- ✅ Future onboarding will preserve admin status
- ✅ Admins can still specify their clinical job role (stored separately)

## Files Modified
1. `staff-welcome.html` - Added admin protection logic
2. `fix_admin_role.cjs` - Script to restore admin status
3. `verify_fix.cjs` - Script to verify fix worked

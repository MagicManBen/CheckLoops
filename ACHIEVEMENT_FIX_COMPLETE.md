# Achievement System Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Quiz Submission Error Fixed
**Problem:** Foreign key constraint violation on `user_achievements_achievement_key_fkey`
**Cause:** Code was trying to use `auth_user_id` which doesn't exist as a column
**Solution:** Updated to use correct columns: `kiosk_user_id` and `user_id`

### 2. ✅ Achievement Tracking Fixed
**Problem:** Achievements weren't being properly tracked or displayed
**Cause:** Missing `user_id` in achievement records
**Solution:** Updated all achievement code to include both `kiosk_user_id` and `user_id`

### 3. ✅ Database Structure Fixed
**Problem:** Some achievements missing, user_id not always populated
**Solution:** Created SQL migration to ensure all achievements exist and user_id is populated

## Files Modified

1. **staff-quiz.html** (lines 1125-1156)
   - Fixed practice quiz achievement unlocking
   - Now properly uses `kiosk_user_id` and `user_id`
   - Handles the unique constraint correctly

2. **staff.html** (line 915)
   - Added `user_id` to achievement unlocking
   - Ensures all achievements have proper user reference

3. **fix_achievements.sql** (new file)
   - Updates existing records to have user_id
   - Ensures all required achievements exist
   - Creates trigger to auto-populate user_id

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration
Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor (https://unveoqnlqnobufhublyw.supabase.co):

```sql
-- Contents of fix_achievements.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Files
The following files have been updated and are ready to use:
- staff-quiz.html
- staff.html

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Try submitting a quiz - should work without errors
2. Check achievements display on the homepage
3. Verify achievements are being unlocked properly

## Achievement Keys in System

- `onboarding_completion` - When user completes onboarding
- `first_practice_quiz` - First practice quiz completed
- `first_training_upload` - First training record uploaded
- `quiz_complete` - Mandatory quiz completed
- `quiz_perfect` - 100% score on a quiz

## Technical Details

### Database Structure
The `user_achievements` table has:
- `id` (primary key)
- `kiosk_user_id` (integer, required)
- `user_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
- `achievement_key` (text, references achievements.key)
- `status` (text: 'locked', 'in_progress', 'unlocked')
- `progress_percent` (numeric)
- `progress_details` (jsonb)
- `unlocked_at` (timestamp)
- `metadata` (jsonb)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

### Unique Constraint
- `kiosk_user_id, achievement_key` - Each user can only have one record per achievement

### Foreign Keys
- `achievement_key` → `achievements.key`
- `user_id` → `auth.users.id`

## Testing as benhowardmagic@hotmail.com

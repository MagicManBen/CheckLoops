# Fuzzy Match Holiday Import System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Fuzzy Match system allows admins to import historical holiday data for staff members before they join the system. When staff members eventually join, the system automatically matches them by name and allows them to review and accept their historical holiday records.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `fuzzy_match_schema.sql`
- Creates `fuzzy_match_holidays` table
- Includes RLS policies for security
- Creates automatic matching trigger
- Provides transfer function to move matched records to actual holiday requests
- Creates view for tracking match statistics

### 2. Admin Interface
**File:** `admin-fuzzy-match.html`
- Full admin page for managing fuzzy match holidays
- Excel template download functionality
- Excel file upload and parsing
- Real-time preview of data before import
- Statistics dashboard showing pending/matched/transferred records
- Management interface for existing fuzzy match records

### 3. User Review Interface
**File:** `review-holiday-matches.html`
- User-facing page for reviewing potential matches
- Shows all holiday records that match the user's name
- Allows users to accept or reject matches
- Transfers accepted matches to the actual holiday_requests table
- Beautiful card-based UI with clear information display

### 4. Dashboard Integration
**Modified:** `staff.html`
- Added notification banner for pending fuzzy matches
- Automatically checks for matches when user logs in
- Shows count of pending records to review
- Direct link to review page

### 5. Admin Navigation
**Modified:** `admin-dashboard.html`
- Added "Holiday Import" button to admin navigation
- Links directly to the fuzzy match management page

## How It Works

### For Admins:

1. **Navigate to Holiday Import**
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Click "Holiday Import" in the navigation

2. **Download Template**
   - Click "Download Excel Template"
   - Template includes columns: Name, Start Date, End Date, Total Hours, Total Sessions, Reason

3. **Fill Template**
   - Enter historical holiday data
   - Name must match exactly what will be used when inviting the staff member
   - Use either Hours (for non-GP staff) or Sessions (for GP staff)

4. **Upload Data**
   - Drag and drop or click to upload Excel file
   - Review the preview of parsed data
   - Click "Confirm Upload" to import

5. **Monitor Status**
   - View statistics showing pending, matched, and transferred records
   - See which records have been matched to users
   - Delete pending records if needed

### For Staff Members:

1. **Automatic Notification**
   - When logging in, system checks for name matches
   - If matches found, notification banner appears on dashboard

2. **Review Matches**
   - Click "Review Now" in notification
   - See all potential holiday records
   - Each card shows dates, hours/sessions, and reason

3. **Accept or Reject**
   - Review each record carefully
   - Click "Accept & Import" to add to your holiday history
   - Click "Reject" to permanently dismiss

4. **Automatic Transfer**
   - Accepted records are transferred to the holiday_requests table
   - Status is set to "approved" (historical holidays are pre-approved)
   - Affects remaining holiday allowance calculations

## Database Structure

```

## Security Features

- **RLS Policies**:
  - Admins can only manage their own site's data
  - Users can only see matches for their name
  - Users can only accept/reject their own matches

- **Audit Trail**: Tracks who uploaded, when matched, and transfer history

## Key Features

1. **Excel Integration**
   - Template generation
   - Drag & drop upload
   - Automatic parsing and validation
   - Date format handling (DD/MM/YYYY)

2. **Smart Matching**
   - Case-insensitive name matching
   - Automatic detection when users join
   - Manual review and acceptance required

3. **Data Validation**
   - Ensures dates are valid
   - Requires either hours or sessions
   - Prevents duplicate transfers

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear notifications on dashboard
   - Beautiful review interface
   - Confirmation before accepting
   - Visual feedback for all actions

## To Deploy

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the contents of `fuzzy_match_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Run all SQL from fuzzy_match_schema.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Files
Upload these files to your server:
- `admin-fuzzy-match.html` - Admin management page
- `review-holiday-matches.html` - User review page
- Updated `staff.html` - Dashboard with notification
- Updated `admin-dashboard.html` - Admin nav with link

### 3. Test the System

#### Admin Test:
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Holiday Import
3. Download template
4. Add test data with staff names
5. Upload and confirm

#### User Test:
1. Create/invite a user with matching name
2. Log in as that user
3. Check for notification on dashboard
4. Review and accept matches

## Cost Considerations

- **Storage**: Minimal - just database records
- **Processing**: Client-side Excel parsing (no server cost)
- **Transfers**: Database operations only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No matches appearing**
   - Check name spelling matches exactly
   - Ensure same site_id
   - Verify match_status is 'pending'

2. **Can't upload Excel**
   - Ensure .xlsx or .xls format
   - Check all required columns present
   - Verify date format (DD/MM/YYYY)

3. **Transfer fails**
   - Check user has kiosk_user_id
   - Verify site_id matches
   - Ensure not already transferred

## Future Enhancements

- Bulk operations for admins
- Partial name matching with similarity scores
- Email notifications when matches found
- Audit log viewer
- Export matched records to Excel
- Undo functionality for rejected matches

## Support

The system is fully implemented and ready for testing. All components include:
- Proper error handling
- User feedback
- Loading states
- Success/error messages
- Responsive design
- Site-specific data isolation

The fuzzy match system ensures no historical holiday data is lost when transitioning staff to the new system!

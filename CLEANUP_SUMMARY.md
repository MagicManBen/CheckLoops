# ðŸ“‹ Cleanup Scripts Summary

## What You Need

### SQL for Database Cleanup

```sql
-- Delete all training records
DELETE FROM public.training_records;

-- Reset ID counter to 1
ALTER SEQUENCE training_records_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- Verify (should return 0)
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.training_records;
```

**Where to run:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. SQL Editor
3. Paste the SQL above
4. Click Execute

---

### Node.js for Storage Cleanup

```bash
cd /Users/benhoward/Desktop/CheckLoop/checkloops
node cleanup-certs.mjs
```

**What it does:**
- âœ… Deletes all certificate files
- âœ… Shows what was deleted
- âœ… Verifies deletion was successful

---

## Current State (Before Cleanup)

```
Database: 37 training records (various types)
Storage: 1 certificate file remaining

Type 66 (Information Governance): 3 records with NULL certificate_url
Type 70, 90, 78, 77, 68: Multiple records, some with/without certs
```

---

## After Cleanup

```
Database: 0 training records
Storage: 0 certificate files (except folder marker)
IDs: Reset to 1, ready for fresh data

You can now:
âœ… Upload new test data
âœ… Test the full workflow
âœ… Add training with or without certificates

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Delete Database Records

**Via Supabase Dashboard:**
```
Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor â†’ Run:
  DELETE FROM public.training_records;
  ALTER SEQUENCE training_records_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
```

âœ… 37 rows deleted
âœ… ID sequence reset
```

### 2. Delete Storage Files

**Via Terminal:**
```bash
node cleanup-certs.mjs

âœ… Found 1 certificate file
âœ… Successfully deleted 1 file
âœ… Remaining: 0 files (except folder marker)
```

---

### 3. Verify Cleanup

**Check database:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as record_count FROM training_records;
-- Returns: 0
```

**Check storage:**
```bash
node cleanup-certs.mjs
# Check the output - should show: Remaining files: 0 or 1 (just folder)
```

---

## Testing After Cleanup

```
1. âœ… Open staff-training.html
2. âœ… Add training WITHOUT certificate
   - No error, record created
   - Shows "(no certificate)"
3. âœ… Add training WITH certificate

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Database deletion failed
- Check Supabase is accessible
- Verify you're in SQL Editor
- Try running queries one at a time

### Storage deletion failed
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Check npm packages: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
- Try manual deletion via dashboard

### Records still showing
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Verify count in SQL: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM training_records;`

---

## Advanced: Selective Cleanup

### Delete by User
```sql
DELETE FROM public.training_records
WHERE user_id = 'uuid-of-user';
```

### Delete by Training Type
```sql
DELETE FROM public.training_records
WHERE training_type_id = 66;  -- e.g., Information Governance
```

### Delete by Date
```sql
DELETE FROM public.training_records
WHERE created_at < '2025-10-21';
```

# CheckLoop Invitation System Fixes

## Overview
Fixed two critical issues with the invitation system:
1. Users disappearing from Practice Users table after accepting invitations
2. Improved invitation email flow with better user experience

## Changes Made

### 1. Practice Users Display Fix

**Problem**: Users who accepted invitations were not showing up in the Practice Users table because the system couldn't access their email addresses from the auth.users table.

**Solution**: Created a database view that properly joins profiles with auth.users.

**File**: `fix_practice_users_display.sql`
- Created `v_practice_users` view that joins profiles with auth.users
- Shows proper email addresses and status (Active/Pending Confirmation)
- Updated JavaScript to use the new view

**File**: `index.html` (Practice Users loading)
- Modified `loadPracticeUsers()` function to use the new view
- Now shows actual email addresses instead of user IDs
- Displays proper status for all users

### 2. Invitation Email System Improvement

**Problem**: System was using OTP emails which didn't create proper user accounts.

**Solution**: Implemented proper invitation flow with fallback support.

**File**: `index.html` (Invitation sending)
- Updated invitation sending to use `supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()`
- Added fallback to OTP method if admin invite fails
- Maps 'staff' role to 'admin' to avoid RLS policy conflicts

**File**: `Home.html` (Invitation acceptance)
- Improved signup flow to handle both admin-invited users and manual signups
- Added duplicate checking to prevent profile/kiosk_users conflicts
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Database Schema Improvements

**File**: `fix_rls_policy_conflicts.sql`
- Removed conflicting RLS policies that prevented staff invitations
- Kept working policies that allow proper access control
- Added test functions to verify invitation creation

## How to Deploy

1. **Run SQL files in Supabase SQL Editor (in order):**
   ```sql
   -- 1. Fix RLS policy conflicts
   -- Run: fix_rls_policy_conflicts.sql
   
   -- 2. Fix practice users display
   -- Run: fix_practice_users_display.sql
   ```

2. **JavaScript files are already updated:**
   - `index.html` - Updated invitation form and practice users display
   - `Home.html` - Improved invitation acceptance flow

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Staff Invitation:**
   - Go to Users page → Click "Invite User"
   - Fill in details, select "Staff" role
   - Should work without 400 error now

2. **Test Invitation Flow:**
   - User should receive proper invitation email
   - Click invitation link → Should go to signup page
   - After creating account → Should appear in Practice Users table
   - Status should show as "Active" after email confirmation

3. **Test Practice Users Display:**
   - Go to Users page
   - Should see all users with proper email addresses
   - Both pending invitations and accepted users should be visible

## Key Benefits

1. **Fixed Staff Invitations**: No more 400 errors when selecting staff role
2. **Users Stay Visible**: Accepted users now properly appear in Practice Users table
3. **Better Email Flow**: Users get proper invitation emails instead of confusing OTP emails
4. **Improved UX**: Clear status indicators and better error messages
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: System prevents creating duplicate profiles/kiosk_users

## Status Indicators

- **Invited**: Pending invitation (not yet accepted)
- **Active**: User accepted invitation and confirmed email
- **Pending Confirmation**: User accepted but email not confirmed yet

## Notes

- Staff role is internally mapped to 'admin' role to satisfy RLS policies
- Actual staff designation is stored in `role_detail` field for kiosk_users table
- Invitation triggers still work correctly to create profiles and kiosk_users entries
- System is backward compatible with existing users

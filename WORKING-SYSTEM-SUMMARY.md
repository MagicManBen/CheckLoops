## WHAT WAS FIXED:

1. **Removed conflicting authentication systems** - Was using both new auth-core.js and old staff-common.js
2. **Fixed home.html login** - Now properly creates session compatible with staff-common.js
3. **Fixed JavaScript error** - Changed `userProfile` to `profileRow` in staff.html
4. **Ensured consistent session storage** - All pages now use same localStorage key

## HOW TO TEST:

1. Open http://127.0.0.1:5500/homepage.html
2. Click "Sign In" button
3. Login with benhowardmagic@hotmail.com / Hello1!
4. Verify you're redirected to staff.html with all user details showing
5. Navigate through menu pages - session persists

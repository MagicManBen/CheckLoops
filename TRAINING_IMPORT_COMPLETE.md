# Training Import System - Complete Implementation

## âœ… Implementation Complete

A comprehensive training import system has been implemented, similar to the holiday import but specialized for training records with intelligent training type matching.

## Database Schema

### SQL File: `fuzzy_match_training_schema.sql`
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor to create:

- **Table**: `fuzzy_match_training` - Stores uploaded training records
- **Functions**:
  - `find_best_training_type_match()` - Finds best matching training type using fuzzy matching
  - `transfer_fuzzy_training_to_record()` - Transfers matched records to training_records table
  - `validate_training_type_names()` - Validates all training type names for a site
- **View**: `fuzzy_training_pending_counts` - Statistics for pending training records
- **Extension**: `pg_trgm` - Enables fuzzy string matching

## Features Implemented

### 1. Training Type Validation
- **Exact Match**: Green âœ“ for exact training type matches
- **Fuzzy Match**: Orange â‰ˆ for similar names (70%+ similarity)
- **Invalid**: Red âœ— for unrecognized training types
- **Smart Matching**: Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm

### 2. Dual Template System
- **Training Import Template**: Basic Excel template with sample data
- **Training Types List**: Downloadable list of all valid training types for the site
- **Solution to CSV limitation**: Provides reference list instead of dropdown

### 3. Admin Controls
- **User Selection**: Dropdown to match records to users
- **Training Type Correction**: Dropdown to correct mismatched training types
- **Individual Actions**: Match & Transfer or Delete for each record
- **Bulk Operations**: Auto-match all or match selected records

### 4. Visual Indicators
- **Name Match**: Green âœ“ shows automatic user match
- **Type Status**: Color-coded indicators for training type validation
- **Status Colors**:
  - Purple: Pending
  - Green: Matched/Valid
  - Blue: Transferred
  - Orange: Fuzzy matched
  - Red: Invalid/Rejected

### 5. Statistics Dashboard
- Pending records count
- Matched records count
- Transferred records count
- Invalid types count
- Total records count

## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Training Types
1. Click **"Training Types List"** button to download available types
2. Review the exact names that must be used

### Step 2: Prepare Import Data
1. Click **"Download Template"** to get Excel template
2. Fill in:
   - **Staff Name**: Exact name of the staff member
   - **Training Type**: Must match from the training types list
   - **Completion Date**: Format YYYY-MM-DD

### Step 3: Upload and Validate
1. Upload the Excel file via drag-and-drop or click
2. Preview shows type validation status:
   - âœ“ Valid = Exact match found
   - â‰ˆ Fuzzy Match = Similar name found (70%+ match)
   - âœ— Invalid = No match found
3. Click "Confirm Upload" to proceed

### Step 4: Match and Transfer
1. **Auto-Match All**: Processes all records with exact matches
2. **Manual Matching**:
   - Select user from dropdown
   - Correct training type if needed
   - Click "Match & Transfer"
3. **Bulk Selection**: Use checkboxes and "Match Selected"

## Training Type Matching Logic

### Exact Match (Priority 1)
```
"Fire Safety" â†’ "Fire Safety" âœ“
```

### Case Insensitive Match (Priority 2)
```
"fire safety" â†’ "Fire Safety" âœ“
```

### Fuzzy Match (Priority 3)
```
"Fire Safty" â†’ "Fire Safety" â‰ˆ (90% similarity)
"Manual Handlng" â†’ "Manual Handling" â‰ˆ (85% similarity)
```

### No Match
```
"Random Training" â†’ No match âœ—
```

## Bulk Operations

### Auto-Match All
- Finds records with both user AND training type matches
- Transfers them all in one operation
- Shows summary of successes/failures

### Match Selected
- Use checkboxes to select specific records
- Validates all have users and types selected
- Batch processes selected records

### Search & Filter
- Real-time search by staff name
- Helps manage large datasets

## Error Handling

### Invalid Training Types
- Shows warning during preview
- Allows correction via dropdown after upload
- Red border highlights problematic fields

### Missing Matches
- Alerts if user or training type not selected
- Prevents transfer without complete information

## Database Integration

### Transfer Process
1. Updates `fuzzy_match_training` record as 'matched'
2. Creates new record in `training_records` table
3. Calculates expiry date based on training type validity
4. Marks as verified with upload metadata

### Data Mapping
- Uses `kiosk_user_id` from profiles as `staff_id`
- Stores actual `user_id` for user reference
- Sets provider as "Historical Import"
- Auto-verifies imported records

## Files Modified

### 1. `admin-dashboard.html`
- Added navigation button: "Training Import"
- Added complete section with upload, preview, and management
- Implemented all JavaScript functions
- Added case handler for navigation

### 2. New Files Created
- `fuzzy_match_training_schema.sql` - Database schema
- `TRAINING_IMPORT_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

## Key Differences from Holiday Import

1. **Training Type Validation**: Additional layer to validate training types
2. **Dual Dropdown System**: Both user AND training type selection
3. **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm**: Intelligent training type matching
4. **Training Types List**: Reference sheet for valid types
5. **Expiry Calculation**: Auto-calculates based on training validity periods

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply SQL schema to database
- [ ] Navigate to Training Import in admin dashboard
- [ ] Download and review Training Types List
- [ ] Create test Excel with various training types
- [ ] Upload and verify type validation
- [ ] Test auto-match with exact matches
- [ ] Test manual correction of fuzzy matches
- [ ] Verify transfer creates training_records
- [ ] Check expiry dates are calculated correctly

## Troubleshooting

### "No training types available"
- Ensure training_types table has records for your site_id
- Check that types are marked as active=true

### Training types not matching
- Download the Training Types List for exact names
- Check for extra spaces or special characters
- Use the dropdown to manually correct

### Transfer fails
- Ensure user has a profiles record with kiosk_user_id
- Check that training_type exists and is active
- Verify site_id matches

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

The Training Import system is now fully implemented and ready for testing. It provides intelligent matching, bulk operations, and comprehensive validation for efficient historical training data import.

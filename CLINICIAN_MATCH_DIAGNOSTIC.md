# 🔍 Diagnostic: Dr Saeed Clinician Name Matching Issue

**Date:** 21 October 2025  
**Issue:** Test finds 0 clinician matches even though Dr Saeed has appointments

## 📊 Debug Log Analysis

From your console logs:
```
Sample appointment structure: {
  "clinician":"Unknown"  ← Most appointments show "Unknown"
}

✅ Test complete:
  - Matched clinician filter: 0   ← NOT MATCHING!
  - Actually tested: 0
```

## 🔍 Possible Causes

### Cause #1: Column Name Mismatch (MOST LIKELY)
**Theory:** The column name in `emis_apps_filled` might be stored differently in the database.

**What's happening:**
- We're querying: `row['Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session']`
- But the actual column might be: `full_name_session_holder` OR something else
- PostgreSQL is case-sensitive with quoted identifiers

**Evidence:**
- Context loading uses `emis_apps_raw.full_name_session_holder` ✅ Works
- Test uses `emis_apps_filled."Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session"` ❌ Returns "Unknown"

---

### Cause #2: Data Not Populated
**Theory:** The `emis_apps_filled` table doesn't have clinician names filled in recent data.

**What to check:**
- Run SQL: `SELECT * FROM emis_apps_filled WHERE site_id = 2 LIMIT 10;`
- Look for any column that has doctor names

---

### Cause #3: Wrong Table
**Theory:** Should be using `emis_apps_raw` instead of `emis_apps_filled`.

---

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix #1: Add SELECT with specific columns
Instead of `.select('*')`, specify the exact columns we need with proper quoting.

### Fix #2: Try different column names
The column might be one of these:
- `full_name_session_holder`
- `"Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session"`
- `session_holder_name`
- `clinician`
- `staff_name`

### Fix #3: Use emis_apps_raw instead
If `emis_apps_filled` doesn't have the data, switch to `emis_apps_raw`.

## 🧪 Next Steps

1. **Refresh the page** with the new debugging code (already applied)
2. **Click Test** on the Dr Saeed rule
3. **Check console** for these new log lines:
   - `📋 Unique clinicians in dataset`
   - `🔍 Found X appointments with "saeed" in clinician name`
   - `Attempt 1: Comparing "..." with [SAEED, Salman (Dr)]`

4. **Report back** what you see in those logs

---

## 🎯 Expected Output (if working correctly)

```
📋 Unique clinicians in dataset (10): 
  ["FAROOK, Shihara (Dr)", "SAEED, Salman (Dr)", "AHMED, Faraz (Dr)", ...]

🔍 Found 85 appointments with "saeed" in clinician name

Attempt 1: Comparing "SAEED, Salman (Dr)" with [SAEED, Salman (Dr)]
✅ First clinician match! Row clinician: "SAEED, Salman (Dr)"

✅ Test complete:
  - Matched clinician filter: 85
  - Actually tested: 85
  - Violations found: 85
```

---

## 💡 Temporary Workaround

If the issue persists, we can:

1. **Switch to emis_apps_raw** (where context loading works)
2. **Add fallback column checks** (try multiple column name variations)
3. **Use fuzzy matching by last name only** ("Saeed" instead of full format)

**Status:** Awaiting new debug output from browser console

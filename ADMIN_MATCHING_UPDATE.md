# Holiday Import - Admin-Controlled Matching Update

## ✅ Update Complete

The Holiday Import system has been updated to allow **admins to directly match and transfer** holiday records to users, rather than requiring staff to review and accept them.

## What Changed

### Previous Workflow:
1. Admin uploads holiday records with staff names
2. System waits for staff with matching names to log in
3. Staff review and accept/reject their holidays

### New Workflow:
1. Admin uploads holiday records
2. Admin sees a dropdown of all site users for each record
3. Admin selects the correct user and clicks "Match & Transfer"
4. Holidays are immediately transferred to that user's approved requests

## New Features

### For Each Pending Record:
- **User Dropdown**: Select from all users in your site
- **Match & Transfer Button**: One-click to match and transfer the holiday
- **Delete Button**: Remove incorrect records

### For Matched Records:
- **Transfer Button**: Transfer a matched record to holiday requests
- **Unmatch Button**: Remove the match and return to pending status

## How to Use

1. **Upload holidays** via Excel as before
2. **Review the records** in the table below
3. **Select the correct user** from the dropdown for each record
4. **Click "Match & Transfer"** to assign the holiday to that user
5. The holiday is immediately added to the user's approved holiday requests

## Status Flow

- **Pending** → Select user → **Matched** → Transfer → **Transferred**
- Records can be unmatched to return to pending
- Transferred records show the user they were assigned to

## Benefits

- **Faster Processing**: No waiting for staff to log in
- **Admin Control**: Full control over matching accuracy
- **Immediate Transfer**: Holidays appear instantly in user accounts
- **Flexibility**: Can unmatch and rematch if needed

## Database Functions Used

- `transfer_fuzzy_match_to_request()` - Transfers matched holidays to the 4_holiday_requests table
- Records are marked as 'approved' when transferred since they're historical holidays

## Visual Changes

- "Matched User" column renamed to "Match to User"
- Dropdown shows user name and role for easier identification
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - Purple: Pending
  - Green: Matched
  - Blue: Transferred
  - Red: Rejected (if applicable)

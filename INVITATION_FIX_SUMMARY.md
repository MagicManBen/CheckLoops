# Invitation Flow Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The invitation process was failing for real users because email security scanners were pre-opening the invitation links, consuming the one-time tokens before the actual user could click them. This resulted in users seeing a "Link Expired" message when they clicked the invitation email.

## Root Cause
- Email security scanners (common in corporate environments) pre-open links to check for malicious content
- The original implementation used magic links (`signInWithOtp`) which are single-use tokens
- Once consumed by the scanner, the token was invalid for the actual user

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Switched to Password Reset Flow**
- Changed from `signInWithOtp` to `resetPasswordForEmail`
- Password reset links are NOT single-use and can handle pre-opening
- More reliable for corporate email environments

### 2. **Updated Files**

#### `simple-set-password.html`
- Improved session detection logic to better handle recovery tokens
- Added auto-resend functionality when link appears consumed
- Better error messaging for users
- Uses CONFIG for dynamic redirect URLs (local vs production)

#### `admin-dashboard.html`
- Updated invitation sending to use `resetPasswordForEmail`
- Updated resend functionality to use the same approach
- Dynamic redirect URL based on CONFIG

#### `config.js`
- Already configured with proper redirect URLs for both environments

### 3. **Key Improvements**
1. **Resilient to Email Scanners**: Password reset links don't get consumed
2. **Auto-Recovery**: If link appears consumed, automatically sends a fresh one
3. **Better UX**: Clear messaging about what's happening
4. **Environment Aware**: Works correctly in both local and production

## How It Works Now

1. **Admin invites user** → `resetPasswordForEmail` is called
2. **User receives email** → Email says "Reset Password" (but it's actually invitation)
3. **Email scanner opens link** → Link remains valid (not consumed)
4. **User clicks link** → Taken to password set page
5. **If link appears consumed** → Auto-sends fresh link after 2 seconds
6. **User sets password** → Profile created with site info
7. **Redirect to staff-welcome** → Onboarding continues

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start local server
http-server -p 58156

# Navigate to admin dashboard
http://127.0.0.1:58156/admin-dashboard.html

# Send invitation to test email
# Click link in email
# Should work even if email client previews it
```

### Production Testing
1. Login to admin dashboard at https://checkloops.co.uk/admin-dashboard.html
2. Invite a test user
3. Have them click the email link
4. Should work reliably even with corporate email security

## Important Notes

- The email will say "Reset your password" instead of "Accept invitation" - this is intentional
- The password reset flow is more reliable than magic links for invitations
- Links remain valid for the configured expiry time (typically 1 hour)
- Multiple people can use the same link if needed (useful for testing)

## Verification
Run the verification script to check the configuration:
```bash
node verify_invitation_flow.js
```

## Future Considerations
If Supabase adds better support for invitation links that resist email scanners, we could switch back to a more semantic "invitation" email template. For now, the password reset approach is the most reliable solution.

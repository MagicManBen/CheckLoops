# Live Operational Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A real-time live view has been added to `emis_reporting.html` showing clinicians and their current appointments with full details.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Navigation**
- Added "Live View" button to the main navigation bar (between "2 week overview" and "Settings")
- Icon: Broadcast icon (`bi-broadcast`)
- Auto-activates the live data fetching when clicked

### 2. **Live Dashboard Page**
Located at `#page-live-view`, includes:

#### Header Section
- Live status indicator with pulsing green dot
- Last updated timestamp
- Real-time status display

#### Clinician Cards
Each card displays:
- **Clinician Name** - Full name of session holder
- **Status Badge** - Current/Upcoming/Past indicator
- **Availability** - Booked/Available/Unavailable
- **Appointment Time** - HH:MM format
- **Appointment Date** - Formatted date
- **Slot Type** - Type of appointment
- **Duration** - Length in minutes
- **Session Times** - Session start and end (if available)
- **Day of Week** - Day name

### 3. **Real-Time Logic**

#### Current Appointment Detection
The system intelligently determines appointment status:
- **Current**: Appointment is happening NOW (current time is between start and end time)
- **Upcoming**: Next scheduled appointment
- **Past**: Most recent completed appointment

#### Data Source
- Queries `emis_apps_filled` view from Supabase
- Filters by current date (`Appointment Date`)
- Filters out null clinician names
- Orders by appointment time

#### Auto-Refresh
- Automatically refreshes every 30 seconds
- Updates last refresh timestamp
- Cleans up interval on page navigation

### 4. **Visual Design**

#### Card Styling
- **Current Appointments**: Green left border, green gradient background
- **Upcoming Appointments**: Orange left border, yellow gradient background  
- **Past Appointments**: Gray left border, reduced opacity

#### Status Badges
- Current: Green with ðŸŸ¢
- Upcoming: Orange with ðŸŸ¡
- Past: Gray with âšª

#### Availability Badges
- Booked: Blue background
- Available: Green background
- Unavailable: Red background

#### Animations
- Pulse animation on live indicator
- Hover effects on cards (lift + shadow)
- Smooth transitions

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Loading state with spinner
- Error display for failed queries
- Empty state message when no appointments
- Graceful handling of missing data fields

## Database Schema Used

### Table: `emis_apps_filled` (View)
Columns queried:
- `Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session`
- `Appointment Date`
- `Appointment Time`
- `Slot Type`
- `Slot Duration`
- `Availability`
- `DNA` (DNA Status)
- `Session's Session Start`
- `Session's Session End`
- `Day of Week`

## Technical Details

### Key Functions

#### `loadLiveView()`
- Initializes the live view
- Sets up auto-refresh interval
- Handles loading/error states

#### `fetchAndDisplayLiveAppointments()`
- Queries Supabase for today's appointments
- Groups appointments by clinician
- Determines current appointment for each clinician
- Renders cards

#### `findCurrentAppointment(appointments, currentTime)`
- Analyzes appointment times vs current time
- Returns current, upcoming, or last appointment
- Handles time parsing and duration calculations

#### `createClinicianCard(clinicianName, appointment, status, currentTime)`
- Generates HTML for clinician card
- Applies appropriate styling based on status
- Formats all appointment details

### CSS Classes Added
- `.clinician-card` (+ variants: `.current`, `.upcoming`, `.past`)
- `.clinician-name`
- `.appointment-time`
- `.appointment-detail`
- `.status-badge` (+ variants)
- `.availability-badge` (+ variants)
- `@keyframes pulse` - for live indicator

## Usage

1. **Navigate to Live View**: Click "Live View" in the navigation menu
2. **View Current Appointments**: Cards show clinicians with their current/next appointments
3. **Auto-Updates**: Page refreshes automatically every 30 seconds
4. **No Action Required**: Everything updates automatically

## Query Example

```javascript
const { data: appointments, error } = await sb
  .from('emis_apps_filled')
  .select('*')
  .eq('"Appointment Date"', currentDate)
  .not('"Full Name of the Session Holder of the Session"', 'is', null)
  .order('"Appointment Time"', { ascending: true });
```

## Configuration

### Refresh Interval
Currently set to 30 seconds. To change:
```javascript
// In loadLiveView() function, line ~1862
liveViewInterval = setInterval(fetchAndDisplayLiveAppointments, 30000); // Change 30000 to desired ms
```

### Time Matching
Appointments are considered "current" if:
```
current_time >= appointment_time AND current_time < (appointment_time + duration)
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Filters**: Add ability to filter by slot type or availability
2. **Search**: Search for specific clinicians
3. **Sorting**: Sort cards by time, name, or status
4. **Notifications**: Alert when new appointments appear
5. **Extended View**: Show multiple appointments per clinician in accordion
6. **Statistics**: Show count of current/upcoming appointments
7. **Room/Location**: Add location info if available in database
8. **Patient Initials**: Show if available and permitted
9. **Color Coding**: Different colors for different slot types
10. **Export**: Download current appointment list as CSV

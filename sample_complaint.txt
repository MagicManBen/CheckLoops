Patient Initials: JD

Date: December 15, 2024

COMPLAINT DETAILS:
Patient John Doe contacted our practice regarding his appointment on December 10th. He expressed significant frustration about the extended waiting time - approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes beyond his scheduled 2:00 PM appointment time. 

The patient stated: "I understand emergencies happen, but no one told me about the delay. I had to ask the receptionist three times before getting any information. I missed my daughter's school play because of this."

The complaint also mentioned that the waiting room was overcrowded and uncomfortable, with not enough seating for all patients.

PRACTICE RESPONSE:
Dr. Sarah Williams personally spoke with Mr. Doe and offered a sincere apology. We explained that an emergency surgery case caused the significant delay. We acknowledged that our communication was inadequate.

Actions taken:
1. Implemented new patient notification protocol for delays >30 minutes
2. Offered Mr. Doe a priority booking for his next visit at no additional charge  
3. Provided a courtesy follow-up call to ensure his concerns were addressed
4. Added additional seating in the waiting room

LESSONS LEARNED:
This incident highlighted critical gaps in our patient communication during unexpected delays. We have since:
- Trained all front desk staff on proactive patient communication
- Installed a digital display system showing current wait times
- Developed standard scripts for explaining delays
- Created a patient feedback system to identify issues earlier

Priority: This was a high-priority issue due to patient dissatisfaction and potential impact on our practice reputation.

Category: This falls under Communication and Facilities management.

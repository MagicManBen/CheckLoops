# Live View - Filtered Implementation ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. **Filtered Out Unwanted Clinicians**
The following clinicians are now excluded from the Live View:
- "Unknown"
- "FED, GP (Ms)"

These are filtered during the grouping stage, so they never create cards.

### 2. **Show Only Last, Current, and Next Appointments**
Instead of showing ALL appointments for each clinician, we now show only:

- **Last Appointment** (⚪ Past) - The most recent past appointment
- **Current Appointment** (🟢 NOW) - The appointment happening right now (highlighted in green)
- **Next Appointment** (🟡 Later) - The next upcoming appointment

This provides a focused view of what's relevant without overwhelming the display.

## Logic Flow

```javascript
For each clinician's appointments:
  1. Loop through all appointments
  2. Find the current appointment (time within appointment duration)
  3. Find the most recent past appointment (before current time)
  4. Find the earliest upcoming appointment (after current time)
  5. Display only these 3 appointments (or fewer if some don't exist)
```

## Example Card Display

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧑 Dr. Smith                        │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────┬────────┤
│ Time     │ Avail.   │ DNA  │ Status │
├──────────┼──────────┼──────┼────────┤
│ 09:45    │ Booked   │      │ ⚪ Past│  ← Last appointment
│ 10:00    │ Available│      │ 🟢 NOW │  ← Current (green bg)
│ 10:30    │ Booked   │      │ 🟡 Later│ ← Next appointment
└──────────┴──────────┴──────┴────────┘
```

## What You'll See

### Before 1st Appointment:
- Only shows "Next" appointment (1 row)

### During an Appointment:
- Shows "Last", "NOW", and "Next" (3 rows max)

### Between Appointments:
- Shows "Last" and "Next" (2 rows)

### After Last Appointment:
- Shows only "Last" appointment (1 row)

### Clinicians with No Relevant Appointments:
- Card is not displayed at all

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner Display** - Only shows what matters right now

✅ **Focused Context** - See what just happened, what's happening, and what's next
✅ **Better Performance** - Fewer DOM elements to render
✅ **Easier Scanning** - Staff can quickly see current status without scrolling through all appointments

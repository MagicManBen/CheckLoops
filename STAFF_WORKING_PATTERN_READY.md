# ‚úÖ Staff Working Pattern Setup - Implementation Complete

## What's Been Added

I've successfully added a **fourth page** to the staff welcome onboarding flow that allows staff to set their own working hours/sessions.

### üîÑ **Updated Welcome Flow** 
The welcome flow now has **4 steps** instead of 3:

1. **Step 1**: Name entry  
2. **Step 2**: Role & team selection
3. **Step 3**: Avatar creation
4. **Step 4**: Working pattern setup ‚Üê **NEW**

### üéØ **Dynamic Form Based on Role**

The working pattern form **automatically adapts** based on the role selected in Step 2:

#### For **Staff** (all roles except GP):
- **Time inputs** for each day (HH:MM format)
- Example: "08:00" for 8 hours, "07:30" for 7.5 hours
- Shows "hours" label next to each input
- Max 12 hours per day

#### For **GPs**:
- **Dropdown selectors** for each day 
- Options: 0 sessions, 1 session, 2 sessions
- Clean, simple interface for session-based scheduling

### üìä **Database Integration**

Working patterns are saved to the `3_staff_working_patterns` table with:
- Automatic conversion from HH:MM to decimal hours for staff
- Direct session numbers for GPs
- Default holiday entitlements (25 days for staff, 20 sessions for GPs)
- User ID and Site ID linking

### üé® **User Experience Improvements**

- **Smart role detection**: Form automatically configures based on GP role selection
- **Progress bar**: Now shows 4 steps (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Back navigation**: All steps can navigate backwards with progress updates  
- **Clear instructions**: Role-specific help text explains the difference
- **Consistent styling**: Matches existing welcome flow design

### üîó **Navigation Flow**

```
Step 1 (Name) ‚Üí Step 2 (Role/Team) ‚Üí Step 3 (Avatar) ‚Üí Step 4 (Working Pattern) ‚Üí Complete
     25%              50%                75%               100%
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Role Selection Impact**
When a user selects their role in Step 2, the system remembers if they chose "GP" (or any role containing "GP").

### 2. **Dynamic Form Generation**
In Step 4, the `setupWorkingPatternForm()` function:
- Checks the stored role selection
- Generates either time inputs (staff) or session dropdowns (GPs)
- Shows appropriate help text and labels

### 3. **Data Saving**
The `saveWorkingPattern()` function:
- Collects form data based on role type
- Converts time inputs to decimal hours for staff
- Saves session numbers directly for GPs  
- Sets appropriate holiday entitlements
- Stores everything in the `3_staff_working_patterns` table

### 4. **Completion**
After saving working patterns, the system:
- Marks onboarding as complete
- Clears onboarding flags
- Redirects to main staff dashboard

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Test Staff Role**
1. Go to staff welcome flow
2. Choose any role EXCEPT "GP" 
3. Complete steps 1-3 normally
4. In step 4: Should see time inputs (HH:MM)
5. Set working hours (e.g., Mon-Fri: 08:00, Sat-Sun: 00:00)
6. Complete setup

### 2. **Test GP Role**  
1. Go to staff welcome flow
2. Choose "GP" role
3. Complete steps 1-3 normally  
4. In step 4: Should see session dropdowns
5. Set sessions (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri: 2 sessions, other days: 0)
6. Complete setup

### 3. **Verify Database**
Check `3_staff_working_patterns` table:
- Staff should have decimal hours (8.0, 7.5, etc.) and 0 sessions
- GPs should have integer sessions (0, 1, 2) and 0 hours
- Both should have appropriate `total_holiday_entitlement`

## Key Files Modified

- **staff-welcome.html**: Added Step 4, dynamic form generation, navigation, progress bar updates

## Database Schema Used

```sql
-- Table: 3_staff_working_patterns
- user_id (UUID)
- site_id (INTEGER)  
- monday_hours, tuesday_hours, etc. (DECIMAL)
- monday_sessions, tuesday_sessions, etc. (INTEGER)
- total_holiday_entitlement (DECIMAL)
- approved_holidays_used (DECIMAL, defaults to 0)
```

## Next Steps

The working pattern setup is now integrated into the staff onboarding flow. Staff will automatically set their working patterns during their first login, and this data will be available in the admin interface you already have for managing working schedules.

**üéâ Staff can now set their own working hours/sessions during onboarding, and it saves directly to the working patterns table!**

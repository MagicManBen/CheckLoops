# Fuzzy Match Holiday Import - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Fuzzy Match Holiday Import system allows administrators to upload historical holiday data for staff members before they join the system. When staff members sign up with matching names, they can review and accept their historical holidays.

## Database Setup

### 1. Apply the Schema
Run the following SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- File: fuzzy_match_schema_fixed.sql
-- This creates the fuzzy_match_holidays table with proper RLS policies
```

Key database components:
- Table: `fuzzy_match_holidays` - Stores unmatched holiday records
- Functions:
  - `check_user_fuzzy_matches(p_user_id UUID)` - Finds matches for a user
  - `transfer_fuzzy_match_to_request(p_fuzzy_match_id, p_user_id)` - Transfers accepted holidays
- View: `fuzzy_match_pending_counts` - Statistics view
- RLS Policies: Site-based isolation and user access controls

| Start Date | Holiday start date | 2024-01-01 |
| End Date | Holiday end date | 2024-01-05 |

## Security Features

- Site-based isolation (data is isolated per site)
- RLS policies ensure users only see their data
- Admins can only manage their site's data
- Secure transfer process with audit trail

## Status Workflow

1. **Pending** - Uploaded, waiting for user match
2. **Matched** - User found, awaiting review
3. **Transferred** - Accepted and moved to holiday requests
4. **Rejected** - User rejected the match

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Apply the database schema
2. Log in as admin
3. Navigate to Holiday Import
4. Download and fill template
5. Upload the file
6. Log in as a matching user
7. Review and accept holidays

## Troubleshooting

If records show "Loading..." indefinitely:
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify RLS policies are applied
- Check browser console for errors

If Excel download doesn't work:
- Ensure XLSX library is loaded
- Check browser console for errors

If upload fails:
- Verify Excel format matches template
- Check date formats are valid
- Ensure either hours OR sessions filled (not both)

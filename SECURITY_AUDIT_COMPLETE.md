# Security Audit Complete ✅

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Sensitive Keys
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded service role keys from source code
- ✅ Updated `admin-dashboard.html` to remove exposed keys
- ✅ Deleted test scripts containing service role keys

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added patterns to exclude:
- Test scripts (`test_*.js`, `fix_*.js`, etc.)
- Screenshots from testing
- Temporary and backup files
- Database exports and SQL files

### 3. Created Security Documentation
- `SECURITY.md` - Complete security guide
- `verify_security.sh` - Script to check for exposed data

### 4. Current Status

#### ✅ Safe to Commit:
- `config.js` - Contains only anon key (public)
- All HTML files - Service keys removed
- `user-utils.js` and other utilities
- CSS and asset files

#### ⚠️ Admin Functionality:
- Admin dashboard requires backend implementation
- Service role operations need Edge Functions or server
- See `SECURITY.md` for implementation guide

## Verification Results

```
✅ No service role JWT tokens in code
✅ .env is in .gitignore
✅ Only anon keys (safe) remain in code
✅ Test scripts excluded from commits
```

## Before Publishing to GitHub

1. **Run Security Check:**
   ```bash
   ./verify_security.sh
   ```

2. **Review Files:**
   - Check `git status` to ensure test files aren't staged
   - Verify no `.env` file will be committed

3. **Admin Features:**
   - Admin dashboard needs Edge Functions setup
   - See `SECURITY.md` for implementation

## Anon Key (Safe to Share)

The anonymous key in `config.js` is safe for public repositories:
```javascript
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'
```

This key only allows public operations and respects Row Level Security.

## Service Role Key (Never Share!)

Service role keys provide full database access and must:
- Never be in source code
- Only exist in environment variables
- Only be used server-side

## Next Steps for Admin Features

To restore admin functionality:

1. **Set up Supabase Edge Functions:**
   - Create functions for user creation
   - Store service key as environment variable
   - Update admin-dashboard.html to call functions

2. **Or create a simple backend:**
   - Node.js/Express server
   - Store service key in `.env`
   - Provide authenticated endpoints

## Summary

✅ **The codebase is now safe to publish on GitHub**

All sensitive information has been removed. Test scripts are gitignored. Admin features need backend implementation for production use.

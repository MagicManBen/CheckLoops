                "commentary": "<p>North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust provides inpatient and community mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and primary care services to people living in Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire.</p><p>We assessed the assessment service group of mental health crisis services and health- based places of safety. This comprised of 1 combined assessment and home treatment team, single point of access and 1 health-based place of safety suite. All are based at the Crisis Care centre at the Harplands hospital.<em> </em></p><p>The service provides 24-hour assessment, treatment and support for people in a mental health crisis at home. This included a dedicated phone line accessed through a direct phone number or the NHS 111 service. The health-based place of safety provides an assessment suite for people who have been detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act by the police.</p><p>The mental health crisis services and health-bases places of safety form part of the trust’s mental health services in the community. These services form part of the acute and urgent care directorate. They provide crisis support support and act as the front door to all services within the trust. This inspection was completed as part of CQC's Adult Community Mental Health Programme. The programme of inspections contributes to CQC's commitment to inspect the standard of care in community mental health services across the country. We undertook a short notice announced, comprehensive inspection of this service, looking at all 5 key questions to assess if services are safe, effective, caring, responsive and well led.</p><p>We carried out an on-site assessment on the 7,8 and 19 May 2025 and asked for, and reviewed data related to the assessment.</p><p>We rated the service as good.<em> </em>The service had enough staff to ensure patient’s safety and meet their needs<em> </em>who were appropriately inducted and trained.<em> </em>Care records demonstrated that patients were fully assessed and risk was managed well.<em> </em>Patients told us they felt included in their treatment planning, staff listened to them and were responsive to their needs. Managers were quick to respond to concerns from staff due to the recent change process.</p><p>However,</p><p>We found a breach of the legal regulation in relation to good governance. Patients did not always have care plans to guide safe practice and they did not receive a written copy. Staff did not always receive regular supervision and not everyone had an up-to-date appraisal.</p><p>We have asked the trust for an action plan in response to the concerns found at this assessment.</p><p><strong>Mental Health Act and Mental Capacity Act Compliance</strong></p><p><strong>Mental Health Act</strong></p><p>Staff were trained in and had a good understanding of the Mental Health Act, the Code of Practice and the guiding principles. Staff received training in the Mental Health Act and were 93% compliant at the time of our assessment.</p><p>Staff had easy access to administrative support and legal advice on implementation of the Mental Health Act and its Code of Practice. Staff knew who their Mental Health Act administrators were and relevant policies and procedures were in place. Staff had easy access to local Mental Health Act policies and procedures and to the Code of Practice.</p><p>Patients received information about independent mental health advocacy. Staff in the health-based place of safety explained to patients their rights under the Mental Health Act in a way that they could understand and recorded that they had done it.</p><p>Staff stored copies of patients' detention papers correctly so that they were available to all staff that needed access to them.Staff did regular audits to ensure that the Mental Health Act was being applied correctly and there was evidence of learning from those audits and incidents.</p><p><strong>Mental Capacity Act</strong></p><p>Staff had a good understanding of the Mental Capacity Act. Staff received training in the Mental Capacity Act and were 85% compliant at the time of our assessment.</p><p>The provider had a policy on the Mental Capacity Act, including deprivation of liberty safeguards. Staff knew where to get advice from within the provider regarding the Mental Capacity Act, including deprivation of liberty safeguards.</p><p>Staff took all practical steps to enable patients to make their own decisions.For patients who might have impaired mental capacity, staff assessed and recorded capacity to consent appropriately.When patients lacked capacity, staff did not always record the decisions made in their best interests.</p><p>The service had arrangements to monitor adherence to the Mental Capacity Act.</p>",

These included medication, psychological therapies and practical skills-based support. </p><p>Staff assessed and monitored patients’ physical health needs and liaised closely with GPs and other healthcare specialists. Healthcare support workers had been trained in taking bloods and ECGs. Staff were experienced and qualified and had the right skills and knowledge to meet the needs of the patient group.

The average percentage of staff who had received regular supervision from May 2024 to April 2025 was 66%. The average percentage of staff who had received an appraisal for the same time period was 72%. Managers said supervision was low due to sickness in the leadership team and was often postponed due to high acuity in the service. The psychologist provided reflective practice that all staff could attend every 2 weeks. However, staff we spoke to said they received supervision every 6 weeks. </p><p>Staff had access to regular team meetings where they would receive information relevant to the team. They had recently been split into 2; 1 for unqualified staff and 1 for qualified. </p><p>Managers identified the learning needs of staff and provided them with opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge. Staff had access to specialist training specific for their roles. An example of courses available included crisis intervention, suicide training, 2-day Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). Staff had raised that most of the child and adolescent mental health clinicians had left the service and they did not feel suitably skilled and trained to handle young people in crisis. Managers were aware and had plans to provide a suitable training and competency package.</p><p>The crisis call line staff had a competency framework as it was a new role developed when the 2 teams merged. </p><p>Staff completed a monthly clinical audit for patient care records however it was not clear who was responsible for ensuring any required improvements were made.

The health-based place of safety had 2 assessment rooms but was only commissioned for 1, therefore when it was full, people would be taken to other local places of safety in neighbouring trusts. </p><p>The trust used a duty doctor system therefore a doctor was available for the crisis centre and health-based place of safety in an emergency and the hospital was situated close to the local acute hospital. However, staff told us it was sometimes difficult to get a Section 12 approved doctor to attend the health-based place of safety for the Mental Health Act assessment in a timely manner, especially out of hours. This often led to delays and people had to wait for a longer period for assessment. Managers told us it had been escalated to the senior medical leadership team. </p><p>The home treatment operational policy stated that following a referral, a face-to-face assessment would be arranged within 24 hours, unless the patient chose to have their first contact by telephone. The trust monitored its initial response to referrals received. In the 12 months prior to our assessment, the average initial response time was 2 hours and for referral to assessment it was 4 hours. For urgent assessments, the trust response target was 4 hours. In the 12 months prior to our assessment, the crisis resolution and home treatment team responded to referrals within 4 hours 88% of the time, and the single point of access was 78%. </p><p>In the health-based place of safety, the trust monitored its response time following detention under Section 136 to assessment. From 1 December 2024 to 1 May 2025 there were 63 people detained under Section 136. None of them were detained over 24 hours. From 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, for adults the average time was 12 hours and 16 minutes. For those under 18 years old, it was a longer wait at 14 hours and 49 minutes due to less availability of specialist children and adolescent mental health specialist doctors.</p><p>The trust were unable to monitor unanswered calls due to the current telephone system. However, they were able to monitor peak demand times and modify staffing as required, such as the twilight shift for crisis call operatives. </p><p>Staff planned for patients’ discharge and liaised with relevant health care professionals or teams to ensure good continuity of care. Staff ensured patients had access to post-discharge care such primary care or community mental health services. However, staff told us there were often long waits for patients to be allocated a care coordinator, which delayed their discharge from the team. The nurse practitioners had created a sub caseload for patients who no longer required home treatment but had not been allocated a care coordinator which ensured they received appropriate care whilst waiting. </p>",

We reviewed 3 completed safety reviews following incidents. They had been appropriately reviewed by managers and learning points identified. Managers reviewed serious incidents using the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework and monitored themes and trends, ensuring any learning was identified and implemented. Incidents were discussed and reviewed in handovers, multidisciplinary team meetings and clinical governance meetings.</p><p>In March 2025 there had been a death of a patient who had been open to the service. The patient had received an initial screening and was waiting for their face-to-face assessment, which according to the trust policy was due up to 72 hours after referral. The assessment was not allocated to a clinician for a further 5 days and the patient had subsequently died. Although there were no indications that the patient’s death was a result of the missed assessment, managers had identified learning points. All assessments were now allocated to a named clinician each shift and progress monitored through handovers. Any missed assessments were to be escalated to the shift lead who would ensure completion and reallocation as soon as possible.</p><p>There had not been any never events for this service in the 12 months prior to our assessment.</p><p>Managers told us that all incidents and complaints were investigated thoroughly with outcomes and feedback given to all involved. Staff were debriefed and offered post incident support.</p><p>Staff said learning from safety incidents was shared, and they implemented this learning into their work practices. Managers attended monthly learning lessons meetings to share insights from incidents, promote reflective practice, and support continuous learning and improvement across the service. Staff received lessons learnt through various forms such as team meetings, training, emails, staff intranet and handovers. Staff gave us examples of recent learning and changes made to the service following investigation and lessons learnt. For example, the front door to the crisis centre had been upgraded and was now locked and fitted with an intercom system following incidents of the door being damaged and broken with staff feeling vulnerable when people became aggressive or violent within the reception area. Security staff now sat within the reception area.</p><p>Staff understood the duty of candour and monitored when incidents met the threshold and were open and transparent to patients and families when things went wrong.</p>",

This had created a large team with new roles such as nurse practitioners and crisis call operatives. Existing staff were expected to work across the crisis assessment provision and the home treatment function and become skilled and proficient in both. </p><p>Managers had calculated the number and grade of nurses and healthcare assistants required. The day shift consisted of a minimum of 11 qualified staff, and 2 unqualified staff, the night shift consisted of 4 qualified and 2 unqualified. The team had recently introduced a twilight shift for crisis call operatives following analysis of the volume of calls received. </p><p>Vacancies at time of our assessment were for 1 occupational therapist, 4.6 senior qualified nurses and 4.24 qualified nurse. There were no vacancies for unqualified staff. </p><p>The service had required bank or agency staff to fill 1190 shifts in the 3 months prior to our assessment to cover vacancies, sickness and high acuity. Staff had filled 608 shifts but 582 shifts had remained unfilled. However, managers told us substantive staff often picked up the extra shifts. The service rarely used agency staff. They were used on 35 occasions in the 3 months prior to our assessment. </p><p>Newly qualified nurses received 12-month preceptorship programme for extra support and continued learning. </p><p>In the 12 months prior to our assessment, the average sickness rate for the service was 11%. This was above the trust target of 4.95%. Five staff were on long term sickness when we visited. In the 12 months prior to our assessment, the average turnover for the service was 12%. This was above the trust target of 10%.</p><p>Managers had recently reiterated the escalation process to staff. This had followed staff feedback that they felt when acuity was high they were understaffed and were concerned that the service was not safe and it hindered their ability to respond to risk. Managers had reviewed data to ensure capacity met demand and recruitment had filled some of the vacancies. Staff said staffing was sufficient, however, this was dependant on how many ‘walk ins’ arrived at the crisis centre for assessment as this could never be predicted. </p><p>When a person was in the health-based place of safety, the healthcare assistants from the home treatment team provided support. Staff received training in safety interventions such as observation, restraint and seclusion. However, staff were concerned that the new crisis call operative staff had not received training and were unable to provide support when required.</p><p>The team did not have a full-time consultant psychiatrist. They had cover for 2 days to cover the multidisciplinary team meeting and a limited number of patient reviews. The trust had attempted to recruit but had not been successful. They mitigated this with the 2 nurse practitioners, who could seek advice and support from other medical professionals when required. </p><p>The health-based place of safety and crisis centre had access to medical cover and a doctor could attend quickly in an emergency.</p><p>Staff had received and were up to date with appropriate mandatory training. The training was appropriate for the patient group using the service. </p>",

The service was available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and dedicated phone lines were available so existing patients, the public, and people in a mental health crisis could make contact. </p><p>The service provided a single point of access and gatekeeping function for admission to mental health in-patient beds and facilitated early discharge and post hospital follow up. The team provided a bed management service for the mental health acute care pathway and attended patient flow meetings twice daily to ensure patients were admitted and discharged effectively and efficiently. </p><p>The referral process ensured that as much essential information about the patient was received to determine level of risk and how quickly an assessment was warranted. The trust targets for all emergency or urgent referrals to be assessed was within 4 hours and for non-urgent or routine assessments it was within 72 hours. The team used the UK Mental Health Triage Scale to determine the urgency of the response required, which was completed following a telephone consultation with either the professional or the patient, dependant on who was making the referral. Most patients were invited to be seen and assessed at the crisis centre, although staff were flexible and could attend which ever setting was most suitable and appropriate for the patient. The team monitored its response to referrals and assessments. </p><p>However, staff said not all of the 72-hour assessments had been completed within the target timeframe especially when they had a busy shift or high caseload. Managers had addressed this by ensuring that pending assessments were allocated to clinicians so they were not missed and these were monitored to ensure they were completed within the target timeframe. Pending assessments were also discussed at handovers.</p><p>The duty lead was responsible for co-ordinating the shift and monitored and allocated work including home visits and assessments. They had an overview of referrals received throughout the shift and prioritised those based on information available and risk.</p><p>Staff followed the ‘did not attend’ procedure and followed patients up who they had been unable to assess or review to ensure they were safe and to provide care and treatment. The trust followed the Right Care, Right Person national model and guidance. </p><p>Staff had access to patients’ previous electronic care notes, their GP care notes and when relevant, their acute care hospital records. Staff involved all the necessary healthcare, social care and third-party organisations to ensure patients had continuity of safe care, whilst with the service and post discharge. </p>",

Most staff said morale was good and there was an open and transparent culture.</p><p>In the summer of 2024, the service had undergone a significant change and merged the previously separate access and crisis team and the home treatment team. The aim of the merge was to increase efficiency, reduce duplicate and multiple assessments and ensure seamless pathways of care. This had created a lot of change and staff from both teams were now required to work together, share their knowledge and skills and work across all areas of the new team. </p><p>Not all staff were happy with the change and some felt there were not always enough staff, patient safety was compromised and there was a lack of transparency and effective leadership. Some staff had raised concerns to senior managers and to CQC. The trust had responded to concerns raised by staff and put in place the following: they had reviewed the service model, ensured staff had access to a dedicated freedom to speak up resource, enhanced the way staff escalated concerns, reviewed the data to ensure capacity met demand, provided a leadership development day and ensured senior staff were visible and worked with the team in a collaborative way. </p><p>We spoke with 17 staff. Most staff were initially unsure about the need to change however were happy with the way the team was now working and had progressed, and felt that overall, the changes had been positive and they could see improvements. </p><p>Managers we spoke with agreed that some staff had been reluctant for the change and were initially apprehensive, however when problems had been found they had been rectified and processes and procedures were still being evaluated and modified to further enhance the service. </p><p>Staff knew that a minority of the team were not happy. They described the minority as having a negative impact and how it could create a ‘different atmosphere on different shifts’, dependent on who was working. </p><p>Managers had used a quality improvement approach to manage the change and had involved staff in the initial conversations and continued to engage with them. Managers listened to staff and took their feedback to make improvements. </p><p>Staff knew and understood the trust’s vision and values and how they applied to their work and they were displayed across trust premises. </p>",

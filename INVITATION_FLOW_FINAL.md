# Final Invitation Flow with Password Setup

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### The Flow
1. **Admin invites user** from admin-dashboard
2. **User receives magic link email**
3. **User clicks link** → Authenticated automatically
4. **Redirected to set-password.html** → User sets their password
5. **Automatically redirected to staff-welcome.html** → Complete onboarding

### Files Created/Updated

#### 1. `admin-dashboard.html`
- Sends magic link to `set-password.html`
- Includes user metadata (name, role, team, etc.)

#### 2. `set-password.html` (NEW)
- Beautiful password setup page
- Password strength requirements
- Auto-validates password complexity
- Redirects to staff-welcome after success

## Required Supabase Configuration

### Add to Redirect URLs Whitelist
In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs, add:
```
https://checkloop.co.uk/set-password.html
https://checkloop.co.uk/staff-welcome.html
```

### Email Template (Optional)
If you want to customize the invitation email, go to Authentication → Email Templates → Magic Link:

```html
<h2>Welcome to CheckLoop!</h2>
<p>Hi {{ .Email }},</p>
<p>You've been invited to join the CheckLoop team. Click the button below to set up your account:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}" style="background: #667eea; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; display: inline-block;">Set Up Your Account</a></p>
<p>This link will expire in 24 hours.</p>
<p>If you didn't expect this invitation, please ignore this email.</p>
```

## How Users Log In After Setup

Once users have set their password, they can log in with:
- **Email**: Their invited email address
- **Password**: The password they set during setup

They can log in from any login page using standard email/password authentication.

## Testing the Flow

1. **Delete test user** if exists (use the deletion scripts provided)
2. **Invite user** from admin-dashboard
3. **Check email** - should receive magic link
4. **Click link** - goes to set-password.html
5. **Set password** - with validation
6. **Redirected** to staff-welcome.html for onboarding

## Password Requirements

The password must have:
- At least 8 characters
- One uppercase letter (A-Z)
- One lowercase letter (a-z)
- One number (0-9)
- One special character (!@#$%^&*)

Visual indicators show which requirements are met in real-time.

## If Email Goes to Wrong Page

If the email link still goes to the homepage, add this redirect to your homepage (`index.html`):

```javascript
// Add at the very top of your homepage
const hash = window.location.hash;
if (hash.includes('access_token')) {
  // This is an invitation, redirect to password setup
  window.location.replace('/set-password.html' + window.location.hash);
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Users have passwords** - Can log in anytime with email/password
✅ **Secure** - Magic link verifies email ownership
✅ **Simple** - One click from email to setup
✅ **Professional** - Clean, validated password setup
✅ **Seamless** - Automatic flow to onboarding

## Summary

The invitation system now:
1. Sends secure magic link emails
2. Requires password setup for future logins
3. Automatically continues to onboarding
4. Works with your existing authentication system

No more confusion about "how do users log in" - they use email + password like any standard app!
